Tux Paint

Tux Paint is a free, award-winning drawing program for children
ages 3 to 12.  It combines an easy-to-use interface, fun sound effects,
and an encouraging cartoon mascot who guides children as they use
the program.

Kids are presented with a blank canvas and a variety of drawing tools
to help them be creative.  Along with paintbrush, shapes and text,
Tux Paint includes a "stamp" feature to add pre-drawn or photographic
imagery to pictures, and a set of "magic tools" that provide filter effects
(like blur, tint and waves) and interesting drawing tools (like train tracks,
bubbles and grass).

Tux Paint includes a collection of "starter" images, both coloring-book style
and photo-realistic, and a large collections of stamps are available
as a separate download. Additional content can be added by parents and
teachers, or downloaded from 3rd parties.

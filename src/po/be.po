#. First, the blacklist. We list font families that can crash Tux Paint
#. via bugs in the SDL_ttf library. We also test fonts to be sure that
#. they have both uppercase and lowercase letters. Note that we do not
#. test for "Aa", because it is OK if uppercase and lowercase are the
#. same (but not nice -- such fonts get a low score later).
#.
#. We test the alphabet twice, to help with translation. If the users
#. will be unable to type ASCII letters, then both Line X and Line Y
#. should be translated. Otherwise, only Line X should be translated
#. and the ASCII-only fonts should be given bad scores in the scoring
#. code below (the best scores going to fonts that support both).
#. Line X

#. Now we score fonts to ensure that the best ones will be placed at
#. the top of the list. The user will see them first. This sorting is
#. especially important for users who have scroll buttons disabled.
#. Translators should do whatever is needed to put crummy fonts last.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fITux Paint\fP is a drawing program for young children.  It is meant to be
easy and fun to use.  It provides a simple interface and fixed canvas size,
and provides access to previous images using a thumbnail browser
(i.e., no access to the underlying filesystem).

Unlike popular drawing programs like "\fIThe GIMP\fP," it has a very limited
toolset. However, it provides a much simpler interface, and has entertaining,
child-oriented additions such as sound effects.

.SH OPTIONS - INFORMATIONAL
.TP 8
.B \-\-help
Display short, helpful information about Tux Paint.
.TP 8
.B \-\-version
Output the version info.
.TP 8
.B \-\-usage
Display a list of all commandline options.
.TP 8
.B \-\-copying
Show the license (GNU GPL) under which Tux Paint is released.

.SH OPTIONS - INTERFACE
.l
\fItuxpaint\fP accepts the following options to alter the interface.
They can be used along with, instead of, or to override options set in
configuration files. (See below.)
.TP 8
.B \-\-fullscreen \-\-windowed
Run \fITux Paint\fP in full-screen mode, or in a window (default).

.TP 8
.B \-\-800x600 \-\-640x480
Run \fITux Paint\fP at 800x600 resolution (EXPERIMENTAL), or
640x480 resolution (default).

.TP 8
.B \-\-nosound \-\-sound
Disable or enable (default) sound.

.TP 8
.B \-\-noquit \-\-quit
Disable or enable (default) the on-screen \fIQuit\fP button.

.TP 8
.B \-\-noprint \-\-print
Disable or enable (default) the \fIPrint\fP command within \fITux Paint\fP.

.TP 8
.B \-\-printdelay=\fISECONDS\fP \-\-printdelay=0
Only allow printing (via the \fIPrint\fP command) once every \fISECONDS\fP
seconds.  Default is 0 (no limitation).

.TP 8
.B \-\-printcfg \-\-noprintcfg
(Windows only.)  Enable or disable loading and saving of printer settings.
By default, \fITux Paint\fP will print to the default printer with default
settings.  Pressing \fI[ALT]\fP while pushing the \fIPrint\fP button
will cause a Windows printer dialog to appear (as long as you're not in
fullscreen mdoe.)  If \-\-printcfg is used, your previous settings will
be loaded when \fITux Paint\fP starts up, and setting changes will be saved
for next time.

.TP 8
.B \-\-simpleshapes \-\-complexshapes
Disable or enable (default) the \fIrotation\fP step when using the
\fIShape\fP tool within \fITux Paint\fP.  When disabled, shapes cannot be
rotated; however, the interface is easier (click, drag, release), which can
be useful for younger or disabled children.

.TP 8
.B \-\-uppercase \-\-mixedcase
In \fIuppercase\fP mode, all text prompts and the \fIText\fP drawing tool
will display only uppercase letters.  This is useful for children who are not
yet comfortable with the lowercase characterset.  Default mode is
\fImixed case\fP.

.TP 8
.B \-\-grab \-\-nograb
Grab the mouse and keyboard input (if possible), so that the mouse is
confined to the \fITux Paint\fP window.  Default is to not grab.

.TP 8
.B \-\-nowheelmouse \-\-wheelmouse
By default, the wheel (jog dial) on a mouse will be used to scroll the
\fIselector\fP on the right of the screen.  This can be disabled, and the
wheel completely ignored, with the \fI\-\-nowheelmouse\fP option.
This is useful for children who aren't yet comfortable with the mouse.
Default is to support the wheel.

.TP 8
.B \-\-nofancycursors \-\-fancycursors
Disable or enable (default) the 'fancy' mouse pointer shapes in \fITux Paint\fP.
While the shapes are larger, and context sensitive, some environments have
trouble displaying the mouse pointer, and/or leave 'trails' on the screen.

.TP 8
.B \-\-keyboard \-\-mouse
The \fIkeyboard\fP option lets the mouse pointer in \fITux Paint\fP be
controlled with the keyboard.  The \fIarrow keys\fP move the pointer.
\fISpacebar\fP acts as the mouse button.

.TP 8
.B \-\-nooutlines \-\-outlines
In \fInooutlines\fP mode, much simpler outlines and 'rubber-band' lines are
displayed when using the \fILines\fP, \fIShapes\fP, \fIStamps\fP and
\fIEraser\fP tools. (This can help when \fITux Paint\fP is run on slower
computers, or displayed on a remote X display.)

.TP 8
.B \-\-savedir \fIDIR\fP
Specify where \fITux Paint\fP should save files.  By default, this is
"~/.tuxpaint/saved" under Linux and Unix, and "userdata\\" under Windows.

.TP 8
.B \-\-saveover \-\-saveovernew \-\-saveoverask
If, when saving a picture, an older version of the file will be overwritten,
\fITux Paint\fP will, by default, ask for confirmation: either
\fIsave over\fP the old file, or \fIcreate\fP a new file.  This prompt
can be disabled with \fI\-\-saveover\fP (which always saves over older versions
of pictures) or \fI\-\-saveovernew\fP (which always saves a new file).
The default is to prompt (\fI\-\-saveoverask\fP).

.SH OPTIONS - LANGUAGE
.l
Various parts of \fITux Paint\fP have been translated into numerous languages.
\fITux Paint\fP will try its best to honor your \fIlocale\fP setting
(i.e., the \fILANG\fP environment variable), if possible.
You can also specifically set the language using options on the command-line
or in a configuration file.

.TP 8
.B \-\-locale \fILOCALE\fP
Specify the language to use, based on locale name (which is typically of the
form \fIlanguage\fP[_\fIterritory\fP][.\fIcodeset\fP][@\fImodifier\fP],
where \fIlanguage\fP is an ISO 639 language code,
\fIterritory\fP is an ISO 3166 country code, and
\fIcodeset\fP is a character set or encoding identifier like ISO-8859-1 or
UTF-8.)
.PP
.RS
For example, \fIde_DE@euro\fP for German, or \fIpt_BR\fP
for Brazilian Portuguese.

.SH OPTIONS - MISCELLANEOUS
.TP 8
.B \-\-nosysconfig
With this option, \fITux Paint\fP will not attempt to read the
system-wide configuration file (typically \fI/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf\fP).

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.l
While \fITux Paint\fB may refer to a number of environment variables indirectly
(e.g., via \fISDL(3)\fP), it only directly accesses the following:
.PP
.TP 8
.B HOME
to determine where picture files go when using the \fISave\fP and \fIOpen\fP
commands within \fITux Paint\fP, to keep track of the current image,
when quitting and restarting \fITux Paint\fP, and to get the user's
configuration file. 

.TP 8
.B LANG
to determine langauge to use, if \fIsetlocale(3)\fP refers to 'LC_MESSAGES'.

.SH FILES
.TP 8
.B /etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf
System-wide configuration file.  It is read first
(unless the \fI\-\-nosysconfig\fP option was given on the command-line).
.RS
.PP
(Created during installation.)
.RE
.TP 8
.B $HOME/.tuxpaintrc
User's configuration file.  It can be used to set default options
(rather than setting them on the command-line every time), and/or to
override any settings in the system-wide configuration file.
.RS
.PP
(Not created or edited automatically; must be created manually.)
.RE
.TP 8
.B $HOME/.tuxpaint/saved/
A directory of previously-saved images (and thumbnails).  Only files in this
directory will be made available using the \fIOpen\fP command within
\fITux Paint\fP.  (See \fItuxpaint-import(1)\fP.)
.RS
.PP
(Created when \fISave\fP command is used.)
.RE
.TP 8
.B $HOME/.tuxpaint/current_id.txt
A reference to the image which was being edited when \fITux Paint\fP was
last quit.  (This image is automatically loaded the next time \fITux Paint\fP
is re-run.)
.RS
.PP
(Created when \fITux Paint\fP is \fIQuit\fP.)

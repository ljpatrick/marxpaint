      If you wish to add or change things like Brushes, Starters,

      other content used by
      <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite>,
      you can do so fairly easily by simply adding, changing, or removing files
      where <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</span> looks for them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: You'll need to restart

            within it:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Bring up a 'context' menu by holding the [Control]

          Aside from a graphical shape, brushes can also be given

        <p>
          A brush data file is simply a text file containing the
          options.

        <p>
          The file has the same name as the PNG image, but a
          "<code>.dat</code>" extension. (e.g.,

            specify the spacing for brushes (that is, how often
            they are drawn). By default, the spacing will be the

            is going.
          </p>

          <p>
            The directional shapes are divided into a 3x3 square in
            a PNG image. For example, if your brush is 30x30, the
            image should be 90x90, and each of the direction's
            shapes placed in a 3x3 grid. The center region is used
            for no motion. The top right is used for motion that's
            both up, and to the right. And so on.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            You may mix both animated and directional features into
            one brush. Use both options
            ("<code><b>frames=<i>N</i></b></code>" and
            "<code><b>directional</b></code>"), in separate lines
            in the brush's "<code>".dat</code>" file.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lay the brush out so that each 3x3 set of directional
            shapes are laid out across a wide PNG image. For
            example, if the brush is 30x30 and there are 5 frames,
            it would be 450x90. (The leftmost 150x90 pixels of the
            image represent the 9 direction shapes for the first
            frame, for example.)
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Place the brush image PNGs (and any data text files) in the
        "<code><b>brushes</b></code>" directory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note: If your new brushes all come out as solid squares or
        rectangles, it's because you forgot to use alpha
        transparency! See the documentation file "PNG.txt" for more
        information and tips.

        All stamp-related files go in the
        "<code><b>stamps</b></code>" directory. It's useful to
        create subdirectories and sub-subdirectories there to
        organize the stamps. (For example, you can have a

        "<code>halloween</code>" and "<code>christmas</code>"

          Rubber Stamps in <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite> can be made up of a

          As of <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite> version 0.9.17, Stamps may be either
          PNG bitmap images or SVG vector images. They can be
          full-color or greyscale. The alpha (transparency) channel
          of PNGs is used to determine the actual shape of the
          picture (otherwise you'll stamp a large rectangle on your
          drawings).
        </p>

        <p>
          PNGs can be any size, and <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite> (by default)
          provides a set of sizing buttons to let the user scale
          the stamp up (larger) and down (smaller).
        </p>

        <p>
          SVGs are vector-based, and will be scaled appropriately
          for the canvas being used in <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note: If your new PNG stamps all have solid
          rectangular-shaped outlines of a solid color (e.g., white
          or black), it's because you forgot to use alpha
          transparency! See the documentation file "<a href=
          "../PNG.txt">PNG.txt</a>" for more information and tips.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note: If your new SVG stamps seem to have a lot of
          whitespace, make sure the SVG 'document' is no larger
          than the shape(s) within. If they are being clipped, make
          sure the 'document' is large enough to contain the
          shape(s). See the documentation file "<a href=
          "../SVG.txt">SVG.txt</a>" for more information and tips.

            There are scripts in the "<code>po</code>" directory

          Aside from a graphical shape, a textual description, and

          Pre-Mirrored and Flipped Images
        </a>
      </h3>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          In some cases, you may wish to provide a pre-drawn
          version of a stamp's mirror-image, flipped image, or even
          both. For example, imagine a picture of a fire&nbsp;truck
          with the words "<i style="white-space: nowrap;">Fire Department</i>" written
          across the side. You probably do not want that text to
          appear backwards when the image is flipped!
        </p>

        <p>
          To create a mirrored version of a stamp that you want
          <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite> to use, rather than mirroring one on its
          own, simply create a second "<code>.png</code>" or
          "<code>.svg</code>" graphics file with the same name,
          except with "<code><b>_mirror</b></code>" before the
          filename extension.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, for the stamp
          "<code><b>truck.png</b></code>" you would create another
          file named "<code><b>truck_mirror.png</b></code>", which
          will be used when the stamp is mirrored (rather than
          using a backwards version of '<code>truck.png</code>').
        </p>

        <p>
          As of <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite> 0.9.18, you may similarly provide a
          pre-flipped image with "<code><b>_flip</b></code>" in the
          name, and/or an image that is both mirrored and flipped,
          by naming it "<code><b>_mirror_flip</b></code>".
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> If the user flips and mirrors an image, and
          a pre-drawn "<code>_mirror_flip</code>" doesn't exist,
          but either "<code>_flip</code>" or "<code>_mirror</code>"
          does, it will be used, and mirrored or flipped,
          respectively.

      <p>
        Unlike pictures drawn in <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite> by users and then

        <p>
          The most basic kind of 'starter' is similar to a picture
          in a coloring book. It's an outline of a shape which you
          can then color in and add details to. In <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite>,
          as you draw, type text, or stamp stamps, the outline
          remains 'above' what you draw. You can erase the parts of
          the drawing you made, but you can't erase the outline.
        </p>

        <p>
          To create this kind of 'starter' image, simply draw an
          outlined picture in a paint program, make the rest of the
          graphic transparent (that will come out as white in
          <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite>), and save it as a PNG format file.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> Previous to Tux Paint 0.9.21, images needed
          to be black and transparent. As of 0.9.21, if a Starter
          is black and white, with no transparency, white will be
          converted to transparent when the Starter is opened.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> Previous to Tux Paint 0.9.22, Starters had
          to be in PNG or JPEG (backgrounds only) format. As of
          0.9.22, they may be in SVG (vector graphics) or KPX
          (templates from Kid Pix, another childrens' drawing

          JPEG within).

        <p>
          Along with the 'coloring-book' style overlay, you can
          also provide a separate background image as part of a
          'starter' picture. The overlay acts the same: it can't be
          drawn over, erased, or affected by 'Magic' tools.
          However, the background can be!
        </p>

        <p>
          When the 'Eraser' tool is used on a picture based on this
          kind of 'starter' image, rather than turning the canvas
          to a solid color, such as white, it returns that part of
          the canvas to the original background picture from the
          'starter'.
        </p>

        <p>
          By creating both an overlay and a background, you can
          create a 'starter' which simulates depth. Imagine a
          background that shows the ocean, and an overlay that's a
          picture of a reef. You can then draw (or stamp) fish in
          the picture. They'll appear in the ocean, but never 'in
          front of' the reef.
        </p>

        <p>
          To create this kind of 'starter' picture, simply create
          an overlay (with transparency) as described above, and
          save it as a PNG. Then create another image (without
          transparency), and save it with the same filename, but
          with "<code>-back</code>" appended to the name. (e.g.,
          "<code>reef-back.png</code>" would be the background
          ocean picture that corresponds to the
          "<code>reef.png</code>" overlay, or foreground.)
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The 'starter' images should be the same size as
        <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint's</cite> canvas.
        (See the "Loading Other Pictures into
        <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite>" section of
        <a href="README.html">README</a> for details on sizing.) If they
        are not, they will be stretched, without affecting the
        shape ("aspect ratio"); however some smudging may be
        applied to the edges.
      </p>

      <p>
        Place them in the "<code><b>starters</b></code>" directory.
        When the 'New' dialog is accessed in <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite>, the
        'starter' images will appear in the screen that appears,
        after the various solid color choices.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> 'Starters' can't be saved over from within
        <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite>, since loading a 'starter' is really like
        creating a new image. (Instead of being blank, though
        there's already something there to work with.) The 'Save'
        command simply creates a new picture, like it would if the
        'New' command had been used.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> 'Starters' are 'attached' to saved pictures,
        via a small text file that has the same name as the saved
        file, but with "<code>.dat</code>" as the extension. This

        affect the drawing even after <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite> has been quit,

        Alternative Input Methods
      </a>
    </h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As of version 0.9.17, <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint's</cite> "Text" tool can
        provide alternative input methods for some languages. For
        example, when <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint</cite> is running with a Japanese
        locale, the <b style="white-space: nowrap;">right [Alt]</b> key can be pressed to
        cycle between Latin, Romanized Hiragana and Romanized
        Katakana modes. This allows native characters and words to
        be entered into the "Text" tool by typing one or more keys
        on a keyboard with Latin characters (e.g., a
        <span style="white-space: nowrap;">US QWERTY</span>
        keyboard).
      </p>

      <p>
        To create an input method for a new locale, create a text
        file with a name based on the locale (e.g.,
        "<code>ja</code>" for Japanese), with "<code>.im</code>" as
        the extension (e.g., "<code>ja.im</code>").
      </p>

      <p>
        The "<code>.im</code>" file can have multiple character
        mapping sections for different character mapping modes. For
        example, on a Japanese typing system, typing
        <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><b>[K]</b> <b>[A]</b></span>
        in Hiragana mode generates a
        different Unicode character than typing
        <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><b>[K]</b> <b>[A]</b></span> in Katakana mode.
      </p>

      <p>
        List the character mappings in this file, one per line.
        Each line should contain (separated by whitespace):
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>the Unicode value of the character, in hexadecimal
        (more than one character can be listed, separated by a
        colon (':'), this allowing some sequences to map to words)
        </li>

        <li>the keycode sequence (the ASCII characters that must be
        entered to generate the Unicode character)
        </li>

        <li>a flag (or "<code>-</code>")
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Start additional character mapping sections with a line
        containign the word "<code>section</code>".
      </p>

        <i>Note:</i> Blank lines within the "<code>.im</code>" file
        will be ignored, as will any text following a
        "<code>#</code>" (pound/hash) character — it can be used to
        denote comments, as seen in the example above.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Note:</i> Meanings of the flags are locale-specific, and
        are processed by the language-specific source code in
        "<code>src/im.c</code>". For example, "<code>b</code>" is
        used in Korean to handle Batchim, which may carry over to
        the next character.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Note:</i> Additional input method support also requires
        additions to <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint's</cite> source code
        (<code>/src/im.c</code>), and requires updates to the
        <code>Makefile</code>, to have the "<code>.im</code>" files
        installed, for use at runtime.

        As of version 0.9.22, <cite style="white-space: nowrap;">Tux Paint's</cite>
        "Text" and "Label" tools can present an on-screen keyboard that allows
        the pointer (via a mouse, eye-tracking systems, etc.) to be used to
        input characters.

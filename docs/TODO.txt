LOW-PRIORITY DOCUMENTATION CHANGES:
-----------------------------------
  * Windows compilation in INSTALL.txt

  * Mention CONFDIR in INSTALL.txt


LOW-PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES:
------------------------------------
  * Fix and use scanline fill for filled shapes.
  
  * Fix "update_shape()" function and use it to replace SDL_Flip()'s

  * Show different text tip for shape tool when in --simpleshapes mode.
  
  * Update Makefile and source so that "*_PREFIX"-like Makefile vars.
    don't require an ending slash!

  * Allow runtime alteration of mouse control keys (in --keyboard mode).

  * Clean up 800x600 support code

  * Make mouse pointer change from hand to arrow when over unselectable
    Selector or Color.

  * Allow locale font files to be specified in conf file
    (so instead of using /usr/local/share/tuxpaint/fonts/locale/ja.ttf,
    it can use /usr/local/share/ttf/kochi-mincho.ttf).
    Distros can take advantage of this.
    (Ben Armstrong's suggestion.)


HIGH-PRIORITY BUGS:
-------------------
  * Figure out why Tux Paint crashes when displaying Euro symbol (under Linux)
    2003.02.22

  * Figure out why fonts don't appear on PPC.
    (Thomas Klausner reported: 2002.09.30)
  
  * Deal with clash between Open dialog arrow key controls and
    mouse arrow key (--keyboard) controls.


LOW-PRIORITY BUGS:
------------------
  * Fix XOR bug with blinking text cursor.
  
  * Fix XOR bug when you 'abort' the shape tool.


PLATFORM-SPECIFIC BUGS:
-----------------------
  * Create a 'tuxpaint-import' type program for Windows.

  * Translated sound effects not working under XP for some reason.
    (Works okay under Win98 and Win2K. - Gabriel G., 2002.09.13;
    still a problem as of 0.9.7, 2003.01.27)

  * Crashing when printing on OS X?  (Reported in v.0.9.2 for OS X)


HIGH-PRIORITY TRANSLATION STUFF:
--------------------------------
  * Make right-to-left strings not wordwrap with the shortest line at
    the top!

  * Finish current translations.

  * Fix Romanian!

  * Tip text (except stamps) aren't translated in --uppercase mode.


LOW-PRIORITY TRANSLATION STUFF:
-------------------------------
  * Support more languages!
    * Hindi
    * Arabic
    * Thai
    ...

  * Update Czech and Slovak translations (so they use accents/etc.!)


FEATURE IDEAS:
--------------
  * Sym-link "~/TuxPaintPictures" to "~/.tuxpaint/saved/"???

  * Add "click to start, click to end" functionality in Brush, Eraser, etc.
    (Pablo Saratxaga's suggestion; 2003.07.19)
    
  * Show shape instructions after _temporarily_ describing the shape???
    (Herman Bruyninckx's suggestion; 2002.08.25)

  * Special command-line options that enable groups of other options
    all at once.  (e.g., "--fullscreen --noquit --printdelay=60 --grab")
    ...and/or pre-written configuration files.
    
    That way a parent/guardian/teacher can very easily set up Tux Paint for
    certain age groups, for example.
  
  * Allow compile-time option (or system config?) that disables
    parsing of ~/.tuxpaintrc and/or command-line options.

  * Allow command-line option to disable parsing of ~/.tuxpaintrc

  * Show only one category of stamps at a time?
    (Provide category selection dialog) !?!?!?

  * Show configuration options (e.g., from ~/.tuxpaintrc) in --version info.


POSSIBLE FEATURE IDEAS:
-----------------------
  * Round eraser
    
  * Support animated brushes (then replace Sparkle magic with one) ??
  
  * Make a 'rainbow' color (then remove Rainbow magic tool; no longer needed) ??
  
  * "Gallery"/slideshow mode (available via Open dialog, maybe?)
    (Ben Armstrong's suggestion: 2002.08.26)

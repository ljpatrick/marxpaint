FEATURE IDEAS:
--------------
  * Allow naming (titling) of images when saving. (As an option)
    (Thanks to Jerry W. Todd for the idea.)

  * "Cartoonify" magic tool.  Kind of like posterize, but different?

  * Create symbolic link "~/TuxPaintPictures" that points to
    "~/.tuxpaint/saved/"???
    FREQUENTLY REQUESTED

  * Add "click to start, click to end" functionality in Brush, Eraser, etc.
    (Pablo Saratxaga's suggestion; 2003.07.19)
    FREQUENTLY REQUESTED
    
  * Show shape instructions after _temporarily_ describing the shape???
    (Herman Bruyninckx's suggestion; 2002.08.25)

  * Special command-line options that enable groups of other options
    all at once.  (e.g., "--fullscreen --noquit --printdelay=60 --grab")
    ...and/or pre-written configuration files.
    
    That way a parent/guardian/teacher can very easily set up Tux Paint for
    certain age groups, for example.
  
  * Allow compile-time option (or system config?) that disables
    parsing of ~/.tuxpaintrc and/or command-line options.

  * Show only one category of stamps at a time?
    (Provide category selection dialog) !?!?!?
    FREQUENTLY REQUESTED

  * Show configuration options (e.g., from ~/.tuxpaintrc) in --version info.


POSSIBLE FEATURE IDEAS:
-----------------------
  * Pipette / color prober tool. Click on it, then click on image to pick
    up a color from a single pixel. Display color under mouse pointer in
    special 'custom color' color bucket (see below) when moving pointer.
    Click and drag a rectangle to select a color which is the arithmetic
    average of the colors in the selected area.

  * Palette. Click on the left-most (or right-most) color bucket (which
    must look a bit different than the rest) to pop up a palette
    (just a rectangular image containing lots of colors in some sort
    of pattern) above it. Click on the palette to select a color. The
    palette disappears (on button *release*).  Can probably reuse
    pipette tool code to pick up color (but don't support the 'average'
    method here). The palette should just be an ordinary image file,
    and easy to replace. I recommend using the one of the left here:
    http://www.ficml.org/jemimap/style/color/wheel.html It's very easy
    to select both hues *and* brightness from this colour wheel.

  * Round eraser
    FREQUENTLY REQUESTED
  
  * Support animated brushes (then replace Sparkle magic with one) ??

  * Support image/stamp 'hoses' (as implemented in numerous other
    graphics programs).
  
  * Make a 'rainbow' color (then remove Rainbow magic tool)
  
  * "Gallery"/slideshow mode (available via Open dialog, maybe?)

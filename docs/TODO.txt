HIGH-PRIORITY DOCUMENTATION CHANGES:
------------------------------------
  * Mention "--lang help" in README.

  * Convert documentation and man pages into a single source (DocBook?)


LOW-PRIORITY DOCUMENTATION CHANGES:
-----------------------------------
  * Windows compilation in INSTALL.txt

  * Mac OS X compilation in INSTALL.txt

  * Mention CONFDIR in INSTALL.txt

  * Add better description of where things get installed in INSTALL.txt

  * Automagically make documentation path correct in man page.
    (Turn man page into a template, then process during compile)


HIGH-PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES:
-------------------------------------
  * Support different default size for stamps than the stamp images size.
    Explanation: For example, the actual image of an apple could be 500x400
    pixels, but selecting the apple would display a scaled down 50x40
    (or 70x56 or whatever) image. Resized (especially scaled up) versions
    of the stamp would then look much better, without any of the very ugly
    pixelation and jagged edges that currently occurs.

  * Use 'default.ttf' font to display un-translated strings.
    (Hindi 'Shusha' font simply maps A-Z, a-z, etc. to Hindi characters, so
    untranslated strings appear as nonsense!)

  * Provide a more Mac OS X style for handling configuration
    (don't use "~/.tuxpaintrc"; see the FIXME in src/tuxpaint.c)

  * Get Mac OS X to look for stamps, brushes, etc. in
    /Library/Preferences/tuxpaint first, then ~/Library/Preferences/tuxpaint

  * Only use "savedir" for saved files, not to look for stamps/brushes.
    Added "datadir" option to override where to look for local stamps/brushes.

  * Coloring book mode -- immutable images stored in Tux Paint's "data"
    directory, but available via the "Open" dialog.  They would be black
    outlines of shapes/pictures for kids to color, like a coloring book.
    The outlines would always remain 'above' the paint.

    FIXME: "Erase" icon on Open screen should disable when you click
    an immutable image.  Re-enable when clicking a saved image.

  * Background mode -- immutable images stored in Tux Paint's "data"
    directory, but available via the "Open" dialog.  They would be
    background images (a 'scene'), and possibly foreground elements,
    as well (think of a photo of a reef, underwater...).  The background
    would be drawn over, but would come back when the "Eraser" tool is used.
    (Any foreground element would always appear 'above' the paint.)


LOW-PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES:
------------------------------------
  * Allow keyboard buttons to alter shapes (+/- for size, e.g.)

  * Fix and use scanline fill for filled shapes.
  
  * Fix "update_shape()" function and use it to replace SDL_Flip()'s

  * Show different text tip for shape tool when in --simpleshapes mode.
  
  * Update Makefile and source so that "*_PREFIX"-like Makefile vars.
    don't require an ending slash!

  * Allow runtime alteration of mouse control keys (in --keyboard mode).

  * Clean up 800x600 support code

  * Allow locale font files to be specified in conf file
    (so instead of using /usr/local/share/tuxpaint/fonts/locale/ja.ttf,
    it can use /usr/local/share/ttf/kochi-mincho.ttf).
    Distros can take advantage of this.
    (Ben Armstrong's suggestion.)

  * Support Ogg Vorbis for stamp sounds, for *much* higher quality and
    much smaller file sizes.


HIGH-PRIORITY BUGS:
-------------------
  * FreeSans font has too large line spacing ('leading'), so there's not
    enough space for two lines of text in the bottom panel. Reducing leading
    for FreeSans font (*not* other fonts, it's only FreeSans that has
    an unusual large amount of leading).

  * Deal with clash between Open dialog arrow key controls and
    mouse arrow key (--keyboard) controls.

  * Handle "en=" and "en.utf8=" properly, when in a different locale
    and there's no specific stamp translation (e.g., don't display
    "en.utf8=..." at the beginning!)


LOW-PRIORITY BUGS:
------------------
  * Fix XOR bug with blinking text cursor.
  
  * Fix XOR bug when you 'abort' the shape tool.


PLATFORM-SPECIFIC BUGS:
-----------------------
  * Support Apple-key buttons ([H]ide, [?]help, [M]inimize, [Q]uit)
    (Is this "META" modifier in SDL_keysyms.h???)

  * Create a 'tuxpaint-import' type program for Windows, Mac OS X and BeOS.
    FREQUENTLY REQUESTED

  * Translated sound effects not working under XP for some reason.
    (Works okay under Win98 and Win2K. - Gabriel G., 2002.09.13;
    still a problem as of 0.9.7, 2003.01.27)


HIGH-PRIORITY TRANSLATION STUFF:
--------------------------------
  * Make right-to-left strings not wordwrap with the shortest line at
    the top!

  * Finish current translations.  (Especially documentation!)


LOW-PRIORITY TRANSLATION STUFF:
-------------------------------
  * Support more languages!
    * Indian:
      * Bengali    (bn)
      * Gujarati   (gu)
      * Kannada    (kn)
      * Malayalam  (ml)
      * Marathi    (mr)
      * Oriya      (or)
      * Punjabi
      * Telugu     (te)
    * Arabic
    * Thai
    ...

  * Translate splash screen text (e.g., copyright, etc.)
  
  * Translate program name (e.g., "Teikne-Tux" in Norwegian)

  * Update Czech and Slovak translations (so they use accents/etc.!)

  * Update Vietnamese translation (so it uses accents/etc.!)


FEATURE IDEAS:
--------------
  * "Cartoonify" magic tool.  Kind of like posterize, but different?

  * Create symbolic link "~/TuxPaintPictures" that points to
    "~/.tuxpaint/saved/"???
    FREQUENTLY REQUESTED

  * Add "click to start, click to end" functionality in Brush, Eraser, etc.
    (Pablo Saratxaga's suggestion; 2003.07.19)
    FREQUENTLY REQUESTED
    
  * Show shape instructions after _temporarily_ describing the shape???
    (Herman Bruyninckx's suggestion; 2002.08.25)

  * Special command-line options that enable groups of other options
    all at once.  (e.g., "--fullscreen --noquit --printdelay=60 --grab")
    ...and/or pre-written configuration files.
    
    That way a parent/guardian/teacher can very easily set up Tux Paint for
    certain age groups, for example.
  
  * Allow compile-time option (or system config?) that disables
    parsing of ~/.tuxpaintrc and/or command-line options.

  * Show only one category of stamps at a time?
    (Provide category selection dialog) !?!?!?
    FREQUENTLY REQUESTED

  * Show configuration options (e.g., from ~/.tuxpaintrc) in --version info.


POSSIBLE FEATURE IDEAS:
-----------------------
  * Pipette / color prober tool. Click on it, then click on image to pick
    up a color from a single pixel. Display color under mouse pointer in special
    'custom color' color bucket (see below) when moving pointer. Click and drag
    a rectangle to select a color which is the arithmetic average of the colors
    in the selected area.

  * Palette. Click on the left-most (or right-most) color bucket (which must look
    a bit different than the rest) to pop up a palette (just a rectangular image
    containing lots of colors in some sort of pattern) above it. Click on the
    palette to select a color. The palette disappears (on button *release*).
    Can probably reuse pipette tool code to pick up color (but don't support the
    'average' method here). The palette should just be an ordinary image file,
    and easy to replace. I recommend using the one of the left here:
    http://www.ficml.org/jemimap/style/color/wheel.html
    It's very easy to select both hues *and* brightness from this colour wheel.

  * Round eraser / eraser sizes
    FREQUENTLY REQUESTED
  
  * Support animated brushes (then replace Sparkle magic with one) ??

  * Support image/stamp 'hoses' (as implemented in numerous other graphics programs).
  
  * Make a 'rainbow' color (then remove Rainbow magic tool;
    no longer needed) ??
  
  * "Gallery"/slideshow mode (available via Open dialog, maybe?)
    (Ben Armstrong's suggestion: 2002.08.26)

Frequently Asked Questions:
---------------------------
  Drawing-related
  ---------------
    The Magic "Fill" Tool Looks Bad
    -------------------------------
      Tux Paint is probably comparing exact pixel colors when filling.
      This is faster, but looks worse.  Run the command "tuxpaint --version"
      from a command line, and you should see, amongst the other output:
      "Low Quality Flood Fill enabled".

      To change this, you must rebuild Tux Paint from source.
      Be sure to remove or comment out any line that says:

        #define LOW_QUALITY_FLOOD_FILL

      in the "tuxpaint.c" file in the "src" directory.


    Stamp outlines are always rectangles
    ------------------------------------
      Tux Paint was built with low-quality (but faster) stamp outlines.

      Rebuild Tux Paint from source.  Be sure to remove or comment out any
      line that says:
    
        #define LOW_QUALITY_STAMP_OUTLINE

      in the "tuxpaint.c" file in the "src" directory.


    The Rubber Stamp tool is greyed out!
    ------------------------------------
      This means that Tux Paint either couldn't find any stamp images,
      or was asked not to load them.

      If you installed Tux Paint, but did not install the separate,
      optional "Stamps" collection, quit Tux Paint and install it now.
      It should be available from the same place you got the main
      Tux Paint program.

      If you don't want to install the default collection of stamps,
      you can just create your own.  See the README documentation for
      more on creating PNG image files, TXT text description files,
      WAV sound files, and DAT text data files that make up stamps.

      Finally, if you install the stamps, and think they should be loading,
      check to see that the "nostamps" option isn't being set.
      (Either via a "--nostamps" option to Tux Paint's command line, or
      "nostamps=yes" in the configuration file.)

      If so, either change/remove the "nostamps" option, or you can
      override it with "--stamps" on the command line or
      "nostamps=no" or "stamps=yes" in a configuration file.


  Interface Problems
  ------------------
    Stamp thumbnails in the Stamp Selector look bad
    -----------------------------------------------
      Tux Paint was probably compiled with the faster, lower quality
      thumbnail code enabled.  Run the command:  "tuxpaint --version" from
      a command line.  If, amongst the other output, you see the text:
      "Low Quality Thumbnails enabled", then this is what's happening.

      Rebuild Tux Paint from source.  Be sure to remove or comment out any
      line that says:
    
        #define LOW_QUALITY_THUMBNAILS

      in the "tuxpaint.c" file in the "src" directory.


    Pictures in the 'Open' dialog look bad
    --------------------------------------
      "Low Quality Thumbnails" is probably enabled.
      See: "Stamp thumbnails in the Stamp Selector look bad", above.


    The color picker buttons are ugly squares, not pretty buttons!
    --------------------------------------------------------------
      Tux Paint was probably compiled with the nice looking color
      selector buttons disabled.  Run the command:  "tuxpaint --version" from
      a command line.  If, amongst the other output, you see the text:
      "Low Quality Color Selector enabled", then this is what's happening.

      Rebuild Tux Paint from source.  Be sure to remove or comment out any
      line that says:
    
        #define LOW_QUALITY_COLOR_SELECTOR

      in the "tuxpaint.c" file in the "src" directory.
  
  
    The Mouse Pointer Leaves Trails!
    --------------------------------
      In Windows under fullscreen, and in Linux under fullscreen outside of
      X-Window, the SDL library has a bug where the mouse pointer can leave
      trails of 'garbage' on the screen.

      Until there's a fix, either don't use fullscreen, or disable the
      fancy mouse pointer shapes using the configuration option:

        nofancycursors=yes

      Or by using this command-line argument:

        --nofancycursors
  
  
    All of the text is in uppercase!
    --------------------------------
      The "uppercase" option is on.

      If you're running Tux Paint from a command-line, make sure you're
      not giving it an "--uppercase" option.

      If you're running Tux Paint by double-clicking an icon, check the
      properties of the icon to see if "--uppercase" is listed as a
      command-line argument.

      If "--uppercase" isn't being sent on the command line, check Tux Paint's
      configuration file ("~/.tuxpaintrc" under Linux and Unix,
      "tuxpaint.cfg" under Windows) for a line reading:  "uppercase=yes".

      Either remove that line, or simply run Tux Paint with the command-line
      argument: "--mixedcase", which will override the uppercase setting.


    Tux Paint is in a weird language!
    ---------------------------------
      Make sure your locale setting is correct.
      See "Tux Paint won't switch to my language", below.


    Tux Paint won't switch to my language
    -------------------------------------
      Linux and Unix users: Make sure the locale is available
      -------------------------------------------------------
        Make sure the locale you want is available.  Check your
        "/etc/locale.gen" file.  See README.txt for the locales
        Tux Paint uses (especially when using the "--lang" option).

        Note: Debian users can simply run "dpkg-reconfigure locales"
        if the locales are managed by dpkg.
      
      If you're using the "--lang" command-line option
      ------------------------------------------------
        Try using the "--locale" command-line option, or your operating system's
        locale settings (e.g., the "$LANG" environment variable), and
        please e-mail us regarding your trouble.
      
      If you're using the "--locale" command-line option
      --------------------------------------------------
        If this doesn't work, please e-mail us regarding your trouble.
    
      If you're trying to use your Operating System's locale
      ------------------------------------------------------
        If this doesn't work, please e-mail us regarding your trouble.

      Make sure you have the necessary font
      -------------------------------------
        Some translations require their own font.  Chinese and Korean,
	for example, need Chinese and Korean TrueType Fonts installed
	and placed in the proper location, respectively.

	The appropriate fonts for such locales can be downloaded from the
	Tux Paint website:

	  http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/download/fonts/


  Printing
  --------
    I get the message "You can't print yet!" when I go to print!
    ------------------------------------------------------------
      The "print delay" option is on.  You can only print once every X seconds.

      If you're running Tux Paint from a command-line, make sure you're
      not giving it a "--printdelay=..." option.

      If you're running Tux Paint by double-clicking an icon, check the
      properties of the icon to see if "--printdelay=..." is listed as
      a command-line argument.

      If a "--printdelay=..." option isn't being sent on the command line,
      check Tux Paint's configuration file ("~/.tuxpaintrc" under Linux and
      Unix, "tuxpaint.cfg" under Windows) for a line reading:
      "printdelay=...".

      Either remove that line, set the delay value to 0 (no delay), or
      decrease the delay to a value you prefer.  (See README.txt).
      Or, you can simply run Tux Paint with the command-line argument:
      "--printdelay=0", which will override the configuration file's setting,
      and allow unlimited printing.  (You won't have to wait between prints.)


    I simply can't print!  The button is greyed out!
    ------------------------------------------------
      The "no print" option is on.

      If you're running Tux Paint from a command-line, make sure you're
      not giving it a "--noprint" option.

      If you're running Tux Paint by double-clicking an icon, check the
      properties of the icon to see if "--noprint" is listed as an argument.

      If "--noprint" isn't on the command-line, check Tux Paint's configuration
      file ("~/.tuxpaintrc" under Linux and Unix, "tuxpaint.cfg" under Windows)
      for a line reading:  "noprint=yes".

      Either remove that line, or simply run Tux Paint with the command-line
      argument: "--print", which will override the configuration file's setting.


  Saving
  ------
    Tux Paint always saves over my old picture!
    -------------------------------------------
      The "save over" option is enabled.  (This disables the prompt
      that would appear when you click 'Save.')

      If you're running Tux Paint from a command-line, make sure you're
      not giving it a "--saveover" option.

      If you're running Tux Paint by double-clicking an icon, check the
      properties of the icon to see if "--saveover" is listed as an argument.

      If "--saveover" isn't on the command-line, check Tux Paint's configuration
      file ("~/.tuxpaintrc" under Linux and Unix, "tuxpaint.cfg" under Windows)
      for a line reading:  "saveover=yes".

      Either remove that line, or simply run Tux Paint with the command-line
      argument: "--saveoverask", which will override the configuration file's
      setting.

      Also, see "Tux Paint always saves a new picture!", below.


    Tux Paint always saves a new picture!
    -------------------------------------
      The "never save over" option is enabled.  (This disables the prompt
      that would appear when you click 'Save.')

      If you're running Tux Paint from a command-line, make sure you're
      not giving it a "--saveovernew" option.

      If you're running Tux Paint by double-clicking an icon, check the
      properties of the icon to see if "--saveovernew" is listed as an argument.

      If "--saveovernew" isn't on the command-line, check Tux Paint's
      configuration file ("~/.tuxpaintrc" under Linux and Unix, "tuxpaint.cfg"
      under Windows) for a line reading:  "saveover=new".

      Either remove that line, or simply run Tux Paint with the command-line
      argument: "--saveoverask", which will override the configuration file's
      setting.

      Also, see "Tux Paint always saves over my old picture!", above.


  Audio Problems
  --------------
    There's no sound!
    -----------------
      First, check the obvious:

        * Are you certain you're using the computer with the sound card? ;^)
        * Are your speakers connected and turned on?
        * Is the volume turned up on your speakers?
        * Is the volume turned up in your Operating System's "mixer?"
        * Are any other programs running that use sound?  (They may be
          'blocking' Tux Paint)

      If sound seems to work otherwise (and you're sure no other program is
      "blocking" the sound device), then Tux Paint is either running with
      a "no sound" option or was compiled with sound support disabled entirely.

      To test whether sound support was enabled when Tux Paint was compiled,
      run Tux Paint from a command line, like so:

        tuxpaint --version

      If, amongst the other information, you see "Sound disabled", then the
      version of Tux Paint you're running has sound disabled.  Recompiled
      Tux Paint, and be sure NOT to build the "nosound" target.
      (i.e., don't run "make nosound")  Be sure SDL_mixer library is available!

      If Tux Paint wasn't build without sound support, make sure you're
      not running Tux Paint with the "--nosound" option as a command-line
      argument.

      If it's not, then check the configuration file ("~/.tuxpaintrc" under
      Linux and Unix, and "tuxpaint.cfg" under Windows) for a line reading:
      "nosound=yes".

      Either remove that line, or simply run Tux Paint with the command-line
      argument: "--sound", which will override the configuration file's setting.


    The sound effects sound strange
    -------------------------------
      This could have to do with how SDL and SDL_mixer were initialized.
      (The buffer size chosen.)

      Please e-mail us with details about your computer system.
      (Operating system and version, sound card, which version of Tux Paint
      you're running (run "tuxpaint --version" to verify), and so on.)


  Fullscreen Mode Problems
  ------------------------
    When I run Tux Paint full-screen and ALT-TAB out, the window turns black!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This is apparently a bug in the SDL library.  Sorry.


    When I run Tux Paint full-screen, it has large borders around it
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
      Linux users - Your X-Window server is probably not set with the
      ability to switch to the desired resolution: 640 x 480.
      (This is typically done manually under the XFree86 server by
      pressing [Ctrl]-[Alt]-[KeyPad Plus] and -[KeyPad Minus].)

      For this to work, your monitor must support that resolution, and
      you need to have it listed in your X server configuration.

      Check the "Display" subsection of the "Screen" section of your
      XFree86 configuration file (typically "/etc/X11/XF86Config-4" or
      "/etc/X11/XF86Config", depending on the version of XFree86 you're
      using; 3.x or 4.x, respectively).

      Add "640x480" to the appropriate "Modes" line.  (e.g., in
      the "Display" subsection that contains 16-bit color depth ("Depth 16"),
      which is what Tux Paint tries to use.)

      e.g.:

        Modes "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"

      Note that some Linux distributions have tools that can make these
      changes for you.  Debian users can run the command
      "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86" as root, for example.


    Tux Paint keeps running in Full Screen mode - I want it windowed!
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
      The "fullscreen" option is set.

      If you're running Tux Paint from a command-line, make sure you're
      not giving it a "--fullscreen" option.

      If you're running Tux Paint by double-clicking an icon, check the
      properties of the icon to see if "--fullscreen" is listed as an argument.

      If "--fullscreen" isn't on the command-line, check Tux Paint's
      configuration file ("~/.tuxpaintrc" under Linux and Unix, 
      "tuxpaint.cfg" under Windows) for a line reading:  "fullscreen=yes".

      Either remove that line, or simply run Tux Paint with the command-line
      argument: "--windowed", which will override the configuration file's
      setting.


  Other Probelms
  --------------
    Tux Paint won't run
    -------------------
      If Tux Paint aborts with the message:
      "You're already running a copy of Tux Paint!",
      this means it has been launched in the last 30 seconds.

      A lockfile ("~/.tuxpaint/lockfile.dat" on Linux and Unix,
      "userdata\lockfile.dat" on Windows) is used to make sure Tux Paint
      isn't run too many times at once (e.g., due to a child impatiently
      clicking its icon more than once).

      Even if the lockfile exists, it contains the 'time' Tux Paint was last
      run.  If it's been more than 30 seconds, Tux Paint should run fine,
      and simply update the lockfile with the current time.

      If multiple users are sharing the directory where this file is stored
      (e.g., on a shared network drive), then you'll need to disable this
      feature.

      To disable the lockfile, add the "--nolockfile" argument to Tux Paint's
      command-line.


    I can't quit Tux Paint
    ----------------------
      The "noquit" option is set.  This disables the "Quit" button in
      Tux Paint's toolbar (greying it out), and prevents Tux Paint from
      being quit using the [Escape] key.

      If Tux Paint is not in fullscreen mode, simply click the
      window close button on Tux Paint's title bar.
      (i.e., the "(x) at the upper right.)

      If Tux Paint is in fullscreen mode, you will need to use the
      [Shift] + [Control] + [Escape] sequence on the keyboard to
      quit Tux Paint.

      (Note: with or without "noquit" set, you can always use the
      [Alt] + [F4] combination on your keyboard to quit Tux Paint.)


    I don't want "noquit" mode enabled!
    -----------------------------------
      If you're running Tux Paint from a command-line, make sure you're
      not giving it a "--noquit" option.

      If you're running Tux Paint by double-clicking an icon, check the
      properties of the icon to see if "--noquit" is listed as an argument.

      If "--noquit" isn't on the command-line, check Tux Paint's
      configuration file ("~/.tuxpaintrc" under Linux and Unix, 
      "tuxpaint.cfg" under Windows) for a line reading:  "noquit=yes".

      Either remove that line, or simply run Tux Paint with the command-line
      argument: "--quit", which will override the configuration file's
      setting.


    Tux Paint keeps writing weird messages to the screen / to a text file
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      A few messages are normal, but if Tux Paint is being extremely verbose
      (like listing the name of every rubber-stamp image it finds while loading
      them), then it was probably compiled with debugging output turned on.

      Rebuild Tux Paint from source.  Be sure to remove or comment out any
      line that says:
    
        #define DEBUG

      in the "tuxpaint.c" file in the "src" directory.

  
    Tux Paint is using options I didn't specify!
    --------------------------------------------
      By default, Tux Paint first looks at configuration files for
      options.

      Unix and Linux
      --------------
        Under Unix and Linux, it first examines the system-wide
        configuration file, located here:

          /etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf

        It then examines the user's personal configuration file:
      
          ~/.tuxpaintrc

        Finally, any options sent as command-line arguments are used.

      Windows
      -------
        Under Windows, Tux Paint first examines the configuration file:

          tuxpaint.cfg

        Then, any options sent as command-line arguments are used.


      This means that if anything is set in a configuration file that
      you don't want set, you'll need to either change the config. file
      (if you can), or override the option on the command-line.

      For example, if "/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf" includes an option
      to disable sound:

        nosound=yes

      You can reenable sound by either adding this option to your own
      ".tuxpainrc" file:

        sound=yes

      Or by using this command-line argument:

        --sound


      Linux and Unix users can also disable the system-wide configuration
      file by including the following command-line argument:

        --nosysconfig

      Tux Paint will then only look at "~/.tuxpaintrc" and command-line
      arguments to determine what options should be set.

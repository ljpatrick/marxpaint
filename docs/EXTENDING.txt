   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   If you wish to add or change things like Brushes and Rubber Stamps used by
   Tux Paint, you can do it fairly easily by simply putting or removing files
   on your hard disk.

   Note: You'll need to restart Tux Paint for the changes to take effect.

Where Files Go

  Standard Files

       Tux Paint looks for its various data files in its 'data' directory.

    Linux and Unix

         Where this directory goes depends on what value was set for
         "DATA_PREFIX" when Tux Paint was built. See INSTALL.txt for details.

         By default, though, the directory is:

           /usr/local/share/tuxpaint/

         If you installed from a package, it is more likely to be:

           /usr/share/tuxpaint/

    Windows

         Tux Paint looks for a directory called 'data' in the same directory
         as the executable. This is the directory that the installer used
         when installing Tux Paint e.g.:

           C:\Program Files\TuxPaint\data

    Mac OS X

         Tux Paint stores its data files inside the "Tux Paint" icon (which
         is actually a special kind of folder on Mac OS X). The following
         steps explain how to get to the folders within:

          1. Bring up a 'context' menu by holding the [Control] key and
             clicking the Tux Paint icon the in Finder. (If you have a mouse
             with more than one button, you can simply right-click the icon.)
          2. Select "Show Contents" from the menu that appears. A new Finder
             window will appear with a folder inside called "Contents."
          3. Open the "Contents" folder and open the "Resources" folder found
             inside.
          4. There, you will find the "starters", "stamps" and "brushes"
             folders. Adding new content to these folders will make the
             content available to any user that launches this copy (icon) of
             Tux Paint.

         Note: If you install a newer version of Tux Paint (by replacing its
         icon), you will lose changes made by following the instructions
         above, so keep backups of your new content (stamps, brushes, etc.).

         Tux Paint also looks for files in a "TuxPaint" folder that you can
         place in your system's "Application Support" folder (found under
         "Library" at the root of your hard disk):

           /Library/Application Support/TuxPaint/

         It also looks for files in the user's "Preferences" folder, e.g.:

           /Users/(user name)/Library/Preferences/TuxPaint/brushes/

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Personal Files

       You can also create brushes, stamps, fonts and 'starters' in your own
       directory (folder) for Tux Paint to find.

    Windows

         Your personal Tux Paint folder is stored in your "Application Data".
         For example, on newer Windows (set up for an English-speaking user):

           C:\Documents and Settings\(user name)\Application Data\TuxPaint\

    Mac OS X

         Your personal Tux Paint folder is stored in your "Library" folder:

           /Users/(user name)/Library/Application Support/ Tux Paint/

    Linux and Unix

         Your personal Tux Paint directory is "$(HOME)/.tuxpaint/" (also
         known as "~/.tuxpaint/".

         That is, if your home directory is "/home/karl", then your Tux Paint
         directory is "/home/karl/.tuxpaint/".

         Don't forget the period (".") before the 'tuxpaint'!

       To add brushes, stamps fonts, and 'starters,' create subdirectories
       under your personal Tux Paint directory named "brushes", "stamps",
       "fonts" and "starters" respectively.

       (For example, if you created a brush named "flower.png", you would put
       it in "~/.tuxpaint/brushes/" under Linux or Unix.)

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brushes

     The brushes used for drawing with the 'Brush' and 'Lines' tools in
     Tux Paint are simply greyscale PNG images.

     The alpha (transparency) of the PNG image is used to determine the shape
     of the brush, which means that the shape can be 'anti-aliased' and even
     partially-transparent!

     Brush images should be no wider than 40 pixels across and no taller than
     40 pixels high. (i.e., the maximum size can be 40 x 40.)

     Just place them in the "brushes" directory.

     Note: If your new brushes all come out as solid squares or rectangles,
     it's because you forgot to use alpha transparency! See the documentation
     file "PNG.txt" for more information and tips.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stamps

     All stamp-related files go in the "stamps" directory. It's useful to
     create subdirectories and sub-subdirectories there to organize the
     stamps. (For example, you can have a "holidays" folder with "halloween"
     and "christmas" sub-folders.)

  Images

       Rubber Stamps in Tux Paint can be made up of a number of separate
       files. The one file that is required is, of course, the picture
       itself.

       The Stamps used by Tux Paint are PNG pictures. They can be full-color
       or greyscale. The alpha (transparency) of the PNG is used to determine
       the actual shape of the picture (otherwise you'll stamp a large
       rectangle on your drawings).

       The PNGs can be any size, but in practice, a 100 pixels wide by
       100 pixels tall (100 x 100) is quite large for Tux Paint.

       Note: If your new stamps all have solid rectangular-shaped outlines of
       a solid color (e.g., white or black), it's because you forgot to use
       alpha transparency! See the documentation file "PNG.txt" for more
       information and tips.

       Advanced Users: The Advanced Stamps HOWTO describes, in detail, how to
       make images which will scale perfectly when used as stamps in
       Tux Paint.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Description Text

       Text (".TXT") files with the same name as the PNG. (e.g.,
       "picture.png"'s description is stored in "picture.txt" in the same
       directory.)

       The first line of the text file will be used as the US English
       description of the stamp's image. It must be encoded in UTF-8.

    Language Support

         Additional lines can be added to the text file to provide
         translations of the description, to be displayed when Tux Paint is
         running in a different locale (like French or Spanish).

         The beginning of the line should correspond to the language code of
         the language in question (e.g., "fr" for French, and "zh_tw" for
         Traditional Chinese), followed by ".utf8=" and the translated
         description (encoded in UTF-8).

         There are scripts in the "po" directory for converting the text
         files to PO format (and back) for easy translation to different
         languages. Therefore you should never add or change translations in
         the .txt files directly.

         If no translation is available for the language Tux Paint is
         currently running in, the US English text is used.

    Windows Users

         Use NotePad or WordPad to edit/create these files. Be sure to save
         them as Plain Text, and make sure they have ".txt" at the end of the
         filename...

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Sound Effects

       WAVE (".WAV") files with the same name as the PNG. (e.g.,
       "picture.png"'s sound effect is the sound "picture.wav" in the same
       directory.)

    Language Support

         For sounds for different locales (e.g., if the sound is someone
         saying a word, and you want translated versions of the word said),
         also create WAV files with the locale's label in the filename, in
         the form: "STAMP_LOCALE.wav"

         "picture.png"'s sound effect, when Tux Paint is run in Spanish mode,
         would be "picture_es.wav". In French mode, "picture_fr.wav". And so
         on...

         If no localized sound effect can be loaded, Tux Paint will attempt
         to load the 'default' sound file. (e.g., "picture.wav")

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Stamp Options

       Aside from a graphical shape, a textual description, and a sound
       effect, stamps can also be given other attributes. To do this, you
       need to create a 'data file' for the stamp.

       A stamp data file is simply a text file containing the options.

       The file has the same name as the PNG image, but a ".dat" extension.
       (e.g., "picture.png"'s data file is the text file "picture.dat" in the
       same directory.)

    Colored Stamps

         Stamps can be made to be either "colorable" or "tintable."

      Colorable

           "Colorable" stamps they work much like brushes - you pick the
           stamp to get the shape, and then pick the color you want it to be.
           (Symbol stamps, like the mathematical and musical ones, are an
           example.)

           Nothing about the original image is used except the transparency
           (from "alpha" channel). The color of the stamp comes out solid.

           Add a line containing the word "colorable" to the stamp's data
           file.

      Tinted

           "Tinted" stamps are similar to "colorable" ones, except the
           details of the original image are kept. (To put it technically,
           the original image is used, but its hue is changed, based on the
           currently-selected color.)

           Add a line containing the word "tintable" to the stamp's data
           file.

        Tinting Options:

             Depending on the contents of your stamp, you might want to have
             Tux Paint use one of a numer of methods when tinting it. Add one
             of the following lines to the stamp's data file:

             "tinter=normal" (default)
                     This is the normal tinting mode.

             "tinter=anyhue"
                     This is ???.

             "tinter=narrow"
                     This is ???.

             "tinter=vector"
                     This is ???.

    Unalterable Stamps

         By default, a stamp can be flipped upside down, shown as a mirror
         image, or both. This is done using the control buttons below the
         stamp selector, at the lower right side of the screen in Tux Paint.

         Sometimes, it doesn't make sense for a stamp to be flippable or
         mirrored; for example, stamps of letters or numbers. Sometimes
         stamps are symmetrical, so letting the user flip or mirror them
         isn't useful.

         To make a stamp un-flippable, add the option "noflip" to the stamp's
         data file.

         To keep a stamp from being mirrored, add a line containing the word
         "nomirror" to the stamp's data file.

    Initial Stamp Size

         By default, Tux Paint assumes that your stamp is sized appropriately
         for unscaled display on a 608x472 canvas. This is the original
         Tux Paint canvas size, provided by a 640x480 screen. Tux Paint will
         then adjust the stamp according to the current canvas size and, if
         enabled, the user's stamp size controls.

         If your stamp would be too big or too small, you can specify a scale
         factor. If your stamp would be 2.5 times as wide (or tall) as it
         should be, add the option "scale 40%" or "scale 5/2" or "scale 2.5"
         or "scale 2:5" to your image. You may include an "=" if you wish, as
         in "scale=40%".

    Windows Users

         You can use NotePad or WordPad to create these file. Be sure to save
         it as Plain Text, and make sure the filename has ".dat" at the end,
         and not ".txt"...

  Pre-Mirrored Images

       In some cases, you may wish to provide a pre-drawn version of a
       stamp's mirror-image. For example, imagine a picture of a fire truck
       with the words "Fire Department" written across the side. You probably
       do not want that text to appear backwards when the image is flipped!

       To create a mirrored version of a stamp that you want Tux Paint to
       use, rather than mirroring one on its own, simply create a second
       ".png" graphics file with the same name, except with the string
       "_mirror" before the filename extension.

       For example, for the stamp "truck.png" you would create another file
       named "truck_mirror.png", which will be used when the stamp is
       mirrored (rather than using a backwards version of 'truck.png').

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fonts

     The fonts used by Tux Paint are TrueType Fonts (TTF).

     Simply place them in the "fonts" directory. Tux Paint will load the font
     and provide four different sizes in the 'Letters' selector when using
     the 'Text' tool.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

'Starters'

     'Starter' images appear in the 'Open' dialog, along with pictures you've
     created. They have a green button background, instead of blue.

     Unlike your saved pictures, however, when you select and open a
     'starter,' you're actually creating a new drawing. Instead of being
     blank, though, the new drawing contains the contents of the 'starter.'
     Additionally, as you edit your new picture, the contents of the original
     'starter' affect it.

     Coloring-Book Style

       The most basic kind of 'starter' is similar to a picture in a coloring
       book. It's an outline of a shape which you can then color in and add
       details to. In Tux Paint, as you draw, type text, or stamp stamps, the
       outline remains 'above' what you draw. You can erase the parts of the
       drawing you made, but you can't erase the outline.

       To create this kind of 'starter' image, simply draw an outlined
       picture in a paint program, make the rest of the graphic transparent
       (that will come out as white in Tux Paint), and save it as a PNG
       format file.

     Scene-Style

       Along with the 'coloring-book' style overlay, you can also provide a
       separate background image as part of a 'starter' picture. The overlay
       acts the same: it can't be drawn over, erased, or affected by 'Magic'
       tools. However, the background can be!

       When the 'Eraser' tool is used on a picture based on this kind of
       'starter' image, rather than turning the canvas white, it returns that
       part of the canvas to the original background picture.

       By creating both an overlay and a background, you can create a
       'starter' which simulates depth. Imagine a background that shows the
       ocean, and an overlay that's a picture of a reef. You can then draw
       (or stamp) fish in the picture. They'll appear in the ocean, but never
       'in front of' the reef.

       To create this kind of 'starter' picture, simply create an overlay
       (with alpha transparency) as described above, and save it as a PNG.
       Then create another image (without transparency), and save it with the
       same filename, but with "-back" appended to the name. (e.g.,
       "reef-back.png" would be the background ocean picture that corresponds
       to the "reef.png" overlay, or foreground.)

     The 'starter' images should be the same size as Tux Paint's canvas. In
     the default 640x480 mode, that is 448x376 pixels. If you're using
     800x600 mode, it should be 608x496. (It should be 192 pixels less wide,
     and 104 pixels less tall than the resolution.)

     Place them in the "starters" directory. When the 'Open' dialog is
     accessed in Tux Paint, the 'starter' images will appear at the beginning
     of the list with a green background.

     Note: 'Starters' can't be saved over from within Tux Paint, since
     loading a 'starter' is really like creating a new image. (Instead of
     being blank, though there's already something there to work with.) The
     'Save' command simply creates a new picture, like it would if the 'New'
     command had been used.

     Note: 'Starters' are 'attached' to saved pictures, via a small text file
     that has the same name as the saved file, but with ".dat" as the
     extension. This allows the overlay and background, if any, to continue
     to affect the drawing even after Tux Paint has been quit, or another
     picture loaded or started. (In other words, if you base a drawing on a
     'starter' image, it will always be affected by it.)

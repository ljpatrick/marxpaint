2003.Aug.02 (0.9.12) [cvs]
  * Fixed Mac OS X #include typo.
    Darrell Walisser <walisser@mac.com>

  * Fixed bug where non-translated stamp description text would get drawn
    right-to-left after the kudos text (e.g., "Great!") goes away.
    Thanks to Itai <Itais@newmail.net>
  
  * French translation update.
    Jacques Chion <Jacques.Chion@wanadoo.fr>

  * Added call to close iconv when quitting.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Walloon translation.
    Pablo Saratxaga <pablo@walon.org>

  * Chinese translation update.
    Wang Jian <lark@linux.net.cn>

  * Fixed bug where translated text would revert to English in 'uppercase' mode.

  * Replaced "efont-serif" fonts with those from the 'ttf-freefont' package,
    for better support of ISO8859-13 symbols (e.g., for Lithuanian).
    Fonts copyright the Free Software Foundation.
    Thanks to Mantas Kriauciunas <monte@mail.lt> for the tip.

  * Fixed UTF-8 related bug where Lithuanian wouldn't display if using
    'TTF_RenderText...', but Spanish wouldn't display if using
    'TTF_RenderUTF8...'.  Thanks to Mantas Kriauciunas, Robert Glowczynski,
    John Popplewell and Karl Ove Hufthammer.

  * Simplified CFLAGS variable in Makefile.
    Ben Armstrong <synrg@sanctuary.nslug.ns.ca>

  * Made main event loop ignore motion events if the loop has spun too long.
    (Fixes problems where shape or stamp tools take forver to 'catch up' with
    the mouse; especially noticable on slow machines over remote X display.)

  * Added some "#error" directives to give verbose output regarding missing
    library header files.  (Typical cause of this symptom is forgetting to
    install dev. packages; e.g., installed "SDL.rpm", but not "SDL-dev.rpm")

  * Removed static "MAX_FILES" limit; now mallocs space for file info.
    structures.  (Should fix large stack crash on OS X, which is good.)

  * Fixed bug where ".thumbs" dir wouldn't get generated if it wasn't there
    and you went to the 'Open' dialog.
  
  * iconv_close() was being called even if 'cd' was -1 (not set).  Fixed.
    Darrell Walisser <walisser@mac.com>

  * If gnome-config is not found, it doesn't necessarily mean Gnome isn't being
    used!  Makefile will now fall-back and assume $GNOME_PREFIX should be /usr,
    so that the launcher icon gets installed into the Gnome menu.
  
  * (About to be) translated to Russian
    Dmitriy Ivanov <ace22b@myrealbox.com>


2003.Jun.17 (0.9.11)
  * Windows bugfixes.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Mac OS X print update.  Get to a print dialog by holding Alt/Option when
    clicking "Print."  (Similar to how Windows handles it.)
    Darrell Walisser <walisser@mac.com>

  * Hebrew translation!
    Dovix <dovix2003@yahoo.com>
    Koby <kobybo@hotmail.com>

  * Right-to-left language support (for Hebrew, for example).

  * Updated Korean translations.
    Mark K. Kim <mark@cbreak.org>

  * UTF-8 support in the Text Tool!
    Robert Glowczynski <robertg@software.com.pl>,
    Mantas Kriauciunas <monte@mail.lt>

  * Added 'The Gimp' to docs/PNG.txt
    Mantas Kriauciunas <monte@mail.lt>

  * Set $OUTPUT_CHARSET for Japanese locale, to fix Win32 issue.
    TOYAMA Shin-ichi <kyone@tky2.3web.ne.jp>

  * Lithuanian translation.
    Mantas Kriauciunas <monte@mail.lt>,
    Rita Verbauskaite <verba@centras.lt>

  * Fixed bug that would cause some translated stamp sounds to not load.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Added Dutch translation of (older version of) HTML documentation.
    (docs/html/README-nl.html; docs/nl/README.txt)
    Geert Stams <geert-csg@wanadoo.nl>

  * Updated Polish translations.
    Robert Glowczynski <robertg@software.com.pl>

  * Added Polish version of manpage.
    Robert Glowczynski <robertg@software.com.pl>

  * Restructured manpage sources (created "src/manpage/")

  * Fixed a few typos in the manpage.
    Robert Glowczynski <robertg@software.com.pl>

  * Fixed UTF-8 word-wrapping bug when there were no spaces
    (e.g., in some Japanese strings)
  
  * When a locale requiring its own font can't be used because the font
    is missing, Tux Paint STILL didn't work right.  Fixed.  (Set $LC_ALL=C)

  * Added a set of square brushes (similar to the various round ones).

  * Added "--nostamps" option to disable stamp tool.
    (When it's not needed, they just take time to load, and RAM to store.)

  * Added missing "--nosysconfig" to "--help" usage output.

  * Increased MAX_FILES from 256 to 2048.  Users with more than 128 images
    saved were unable to load the newest images!  (Hopefully 1024 saved
    files is sufficient.)

  * Thumbnails now saved to a ".thumbs" subdirectory under "saved".
    (Old thumbnails will still be loaded, if found.  Currently, the old
    thumbnails will still be saved in the old location, not under .thumbs)
    Ben Armstrong's suggestion.

  * Updated tuxpaint-import to create .thumbs subdirectory, and put new
    thumbnails there.

  * Moved "tuxpaint-import.1" from src/ to src/manpage/.

  * "Thick" and "Thin" Magic Tools made 'stronger.'


2003.February.22 (0.9.10)
  * UTF-8 stamp descriptions word-wrap around spaces.

  * Portuguese (from Portugal) translation.
    Ricardo Cruz <rick2@aeiu.pt>

  * Support for more HTML escape codes in description files.
    [ Not yet working ]

  * Czech .po file renamed to the correct "cs.po".
  
  * ALT+F4 accepted as alternative to [Escape] (to quit)
    by Tux Paint's main loop.  Windows wasn't rending a 'Close Window'
    event on that key combo, like it should (I think).
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Windows printing changes:
    + Now uses a default printer configuration.
    + No pop-up dialog appears unless [ALT] is held while hitting "Print"
      button in the toolbox.
    + Can be told to save any changes to printer configuration (so it's
      used as default configuration from now on) by sending the
      "--printcfg" command-line option.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Fancy cursors automatically disabled when in fullscreen mode in Windows.
    (A bug in SDL causes the larger cursors to leave trails on the screen.)

  * BeOS version will chdir to where Tux Paint is, if launched from a GUI
    (e.g., OpenTracker)
    Marcin 'Shard' Konicki <shard at beosjournal.org>

  * Included new "src/Makefile.beos"
    Marcin 'Shard' Konicki <shard at beosjournal.org>


2003.February.1 (0.9.9)
  * Translated into Slovak!
    Milan Plzik <mmp@golem.gymzv.sk>

  * Updated Norwegian Nynorsk translation.
    Karl Ove Hufthammer <karl@huftis.org>

  * Added Japanese translation to Tux Paint icon (tuxpaint.desktop)
    TOYAMA Shin-ichi <kyone@tky2.3web.ne.jp>

  * Moved Makefile.beos into src/, to keep root directory less cluttered.

  * Incorporated "tuxpaint.nsi" in src/
    (A configuration file for creating an installer program for
    Windows, using Nullsoft's Scriptable Install System
    <http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/>)
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Alphabetized locale generation/installation in Makefile
    (partly for nicer looking output during compilation, but mostly for
    easier maintenance)

  * When a locale requiring its own font can't be used because the font
    is missing, Tux Paint now CORRECTLY switches back to default
    ($LANG=C, which for Tux Paint is 'American English')

  * Removed some debugging output that shouldn't have been kept in.

  * Locale-detection code made more robust.  (Check LC_MESSAGES, not LC_ALL)
    TOYAMA Shin-ichi <kyone@tky2.3web.ne.jp>

  * Added support for some useful HTML escape sequences in stamp descriptions
    (e.g., "&acute;" for "á" ("a" with "'" over it))
    Append ".esc" to the locale code (e.g., "fr.esc=...") in the ".txt"
    description files.

  * Wrote "docs/ESCAPES.txt", which covers valid escape sequences.

  * Made 800x600 mode available at runtime, rather than just at compile-time
    (available "--800x600" command-line option and "800x600=yes" in conf. file;
    overridden by "--640x480" option, or "800x600=no" or "640x480=yes" in conf.)
    NOTE: STILL EXPERIMENTAL!  640x480 mode is still default!
  
  * Fixed 'Magic Tool' selector redraw bug in 800x600 mode.


2003.January.27 (0.9.8)
  * Updated Makefile to include "beos" and "beos-install" targets.
    (Apparently doesn't work yet.)
    Based on BeOS Makefile by Marcin 'Shard' Konicki <shard at beosjournal.org>

  * Included Makefile.beos for BeOS.
    (Needs updating to match newer upstream Makefile)
    Marcin 'Shard' Konicki <shard at beosjournal.org>

  * Added some translations to Tux Paint's icon's comment in tuxpaint.desktop.

  * Updated default tuxpaint.conf to mention all of the newest options.

  * Fixed tuxpaint.desktop's icon so that it works right under Gnome.

  * Fixed crash that could happen when picking an unavailable spot in the
    selector on the right.

  * Fixed Japanese locale detection.
    TOYAMA Shin-ichi <kyone@tky2.3web.ne.jp>

  * Stamp description translations can be encoded using UTF-8.
    Append ".utf8" to the locale code (e.g., "fr.utf8=...")

  * Removed stamp descriptions from Japanese translation file
    (src/messages/ja.po).  (Will be placed as UTF-8 encoded text in next
    Tux Paint stamps package release.)


2003.January.26 (0.9.7)
  * Translated to Japanese!
    TOYAMA Shin-ichi <kyone@tky2.3web.ne.jp>

  * Fixed translation bugs with some save-related prompts.

  * Polish available as "--lang polski" as well.

  * Disabled fancy cursors by default in BeOS.  (Support is buggy in SDL.)
    Marcin 'Shard' Konicki <shard at beosjournal.org>

  * BeOS updates.
    Marcin 'Shard' Konicki <shard at beosjournal.org>


2003.January.22 (0.9.6)

  * BeOS printing support!  (Makefile needs updating)
    Marcin 'Shard' Konicki <shard at beosjournal.org>

  * tuxpaint-import now creates the '~/.tuxpaint/saved' directory,
    if it doesn't exist

  * Initial support for arbitrary window sizes.  (#define SVGA for 800x600)
    TOYAMA Shin-ichi <kyone@tky2.3web.ne.jp>

  * Added a few new colors, renamed some old ones.
    TOYAMA Shin-ichi <kyone@tky2.3web.ne.jp>

  * Changed sparkles so they look less like blobs.
    (Thanks to Dave Nelson for the suggestion.)

  * Added a mode that uses XORs ("rubber-band lines") much less:  --nooutlines
    It should help for very slow machines and using Tux Paint remotely
    over a networked X display.

  * The 'Circle' shape no longer switches into rotation mode
    (since it never affected the shape!)


2003.January.6  (0.9.3)

    "--lang portugues-brazilian")
    Daniel Jose Viana <danjovic@vespanet.com.br>

  * Fixed 'get_fname()' so that it won't return a directory name with
    a trailing slash (if no filename was given).  Some 'mkdir()'s don't
    like trailing slashes.
    Thomas Klausner <wiz@danbala.ifoer.tuwien.ac.at>

  * "lang=" setting is now recognized in configuration files.

  * Default configuration file now exists (Unix/Linux).
    Installed as /etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf.
    (Unless 'PREFIX' is not '/usr' or '/usr/local', then it's
    installed into $(PREFIX)/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf.
    Overridable by setting CONFDIR Makefile variable)
    Read before "~/.tuxpaintrc".
    Reading it can be disabled with "--nosysconfig" on command-line.

  * Added support for "OPTION=no" in config file, as well as
    "UNOPTION=yes" (like command-line args. use), so that "~/.tuxpaintrc"
    can override any settings in new system config.
    (e.g., "noprint=no" or "print=yes" will override a "noprint=yes")

  * Updated INSTALL.txt and README.txt for Windows users.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Updated Spanish documentation.
    Gabriel Gazzan <ggabriel@internet.com.uy>

  * Added warnings about untranslated strings ("NOTRANS: ...") to
    debugging output.  ("#define DEBUG")  (Useful for translators.)

  * Added option to disable 'fancy' mouse pointers:  --nofancycursors
    (since fullscreen under Windows and non-X-Window targets under Linux
    currently have problems due to an SDL library bug)

  * Changed 'tuxpaint-import's usage message to reflect that it can import
    multiple files at a time, and that it has a "--help" option.

  * Updated 'tuxpaint-import's help message to describe what the program does.


2002.September.25
  * Translated to Danish.
    Rasmus Erik Voel Jensen <i18n@solsort.dk>

    Replaced with the old tip text (e.g., stamp description, 
    instructions, etc.) after a moment.
    Fabian Franz <FabianFranz@gmx.de>

  * Prompt and label font is smaller when in "--uppercase" mode.

  * "Open", "Erase" and "Back" buttons in 'Open' dialog are now translatable.
    (Still need to translate selector titles (e.g., "Tools", "Colors", etc.))


2002.September.23
  * Replaced key-repeat code with simple SDL-based key repeat.
    Fabian Franz <FabianFranz@gmx.de>

  * Fixed toolbar bug when using 'Save' via [Ctrl]-[S] shortcut.
    Fabian Franz <FabianFranz@gmx.de>

  * Shortcut keys for "Yes" and "No" prompts are now based on the
    first character of the translated versions of those words.
    (e.g., in Spanish, [S] for "Si", and [N] for "No".
    In German, [J] for "Ja", and [N] for "Nein".)
    Fabian Franz <FabianFranz@gmx.de>

  * Added URLs to Windows and Mac software in PNG.txt.

  * README updated.

  * Some documentation translated to German.  (See "docs/de/")
    (Using Google.com Language Tools)

  * Placeholders created for some other translated documentation.

  * Translated documentation gets installed now.

  * 'Print' tool disabled when picture is blank
    (Simply mimicks 'New' tool)
    Fabian Franz <FabianFranz@gmx.de>

  * Mouse wheel now scrolls selector (e.g., list of stamps, brushes, etc.)
    (Non-wheel mouse users can try it with mouse buttons 2 and 3 under
    X-Window by running:   xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 4 5"  )
    Fabian Franz <FabianFranz@gmx.de>

  * Mouse wheel can be disabled with "nowheelmouse=yes" in config., or
    "--nowheelmouse" on commandline.


2002.September.22
  * Updated Spanish documentation.  (Added translation of PNG.txt)
    Gabriel Gazzan <ggabriel@internet.com.uy>

  * Updated Norwegian translations.
    Karl Ove Hufthammer <karl@huftis.org>

  * Free mouse pointer shapes on exit.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

    but could be - e.g., if the user happens to use CVS)
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>


2002.September.21
  * Selector scroll buttons 'repeat' if mouse is held down on them.
    Fabian Franz <FabianFranz@gmx.de>

  * Rotate mode of shape tool has its own mouse pointer shape.

  * Rotate mode of shape tool warps mouse to '0 degree' rotation spot.

  * Increased threshold of Magic 'Fill' tool.

  * Created "tuxpaint-import" shell script which will take an arbitrary
    image file (JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.) and make a copy available to Tux Paint
    (by converting it to an appropriately-sized and -shaped PNG file and
    placing it in "~/.tuxpaint/saved/").  Only works under Linux and Unix...

  * Fixed bug where trying to type a Control character in the 'Text' tool
    would crash Tux Paint.

  * Some updates to man page (tuxpaint.sgml).  Ugh!  Help me!

  * Rearranged and reprioritized TODO.txt some more.

  * Blinking cursor in text tool moves right now.

  * Keys repeat in text tool.

  * Fixed bug where 'Fill' could recurse infinitely and crash Tux Paint.


2002.September.20
  * Updated AUTHORS.txt

  * Updated README.txt (regarding brushes, stamps, fonts).

  * Added a flood fill ("bucket fill") Magic tool.
    Based on http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill/C_example
    by Damian Yerrick - http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Yerrick

  * Flood fill can be faster and lower quality.
    #define LOW_QUALITY_FLOOD_FILL, and only exact pixel matches will be
    checked for.

  * Thumbnails in 'Open' dialog can be double-clicked to open them.

  * Brushes, stamps and fonts can be stored in the user's
    tuxpaint directory.  ("~/.tuxpaint/" under Linux and Unix,
    "userdata" under Windows.)  They go under "brushes", "stamps" and "fonts"
    subdirectories, respectively.


2002.September.19
  * Updated Spanish documentation.
    Gabriel Gazzan <ggabriel@internet.com.uy>

  * Updated INSTALL.txt with steps that Installer EXE goes through.

  * Icelandic translation.
    Pjetur G. Hjaltason <pjetur@pjetur.net>

  * Color selector and current tool's selector greyed out in 'Open' dialog.
    (Good solution for now...)

  * Font and color changes while typing text are reflected by the preview.
  
  * Background of text preview is dark grey if the rendered text color is light.

  * [Enter] key moves text cursor down one line and starts a new line of text.

  * Undo/Redo works better with text tool.

  * Text tool rendering is clipped to canvas area (no more overwriting
    Tux Paint's widgets)

  * Text tool cursor height corresponds to current font's general height.

  * Clicking a new position while entering text moves the current text,
    rather than rendering it and starting a new line.

  * Text tool allows broader range of characters
    (e.g., uppercase, punctuation, etc.) thanks to
    'event.key.keysym.unicode' values.


2002.September.15
  * "Save over the older version...?" prompt can be disabled.
    "--saveover" (or "saveover=yes") will always save over the existing file.
    "--saveovernew" (or "saveover=new") will always save a new file.
    "--saveoverask" (or "saveover=ask") will prompt (the old, and default mode)
    (Karl Ove Hufthammer's suggestion)
    
  * Added option to have Tux Paint grab all keyboard and mouse input.
    This should keep the mouse inside Tux Paint's window and override
    things like [Alt]-[Tab] window cycling and [Alt]-[Enter] fullscreen
    toggling.

  * Context-sensitive mouse pointer shapes!

  * Fixed some indentation anomolies in tuxpaint.c

  * Increased audio buffer even more (2Kbytes) under Windows, for better sound.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Cleaned up memory leaks from 'uppercase()' calls.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Cleaned up loaded fonts when quitting.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Mouse buttons 2 and 3 supported again.  (Wheel still not used.)
    Partly because kids may get frustrated using 2- and 3-button mice.
    Partly due to a lefthand/righthand bug in SDL for Windows in fullscreen.
    (Thanks to John Popplewell.)


2002.September.14
  * Fixed bug where tool tip would revert to English.
    (Thanks to Karl Ove Hufthammer and John Popplewell)

  * Fixed README.txt regarding Norwegian.

  * Update Spanish translation.
    Gabriel Gazzan <ggabriel@internet.com.uy>

  * Stamp description no longer replaced with "Great!" when stamp drawn.
    (Thanks to Karl Ove Hufthammer for the suggestion.)

  * "Your picture has been saved" prompt when saving-on-quit is now
    translated properly.

  * Added "--uppercase" option, which renders all text strings entirely
    in uppercase (for children who haven't learned lowercase letters yet).
    (Or use "uppercase=yes" in config. file.  "--mixedcase" to override config.)

  * Created an Frequently Asked Questions document: FAQ.txt.

  * More compile-time options reported (if set) in "--version" output.

  * Only mouse button 1 (left-click) is used now.  All other buttons ignored.
    (Avoids problems with mouse wheels causing 'hyper clicking.')
    (Perhaps it should be buttons 1 through 3?)


2002.September.12
  * Translated to Swedish.
    Daniel Andersson <daniel@septum.org>

  * More work on the text tool.
    (Now activated by default, but still not perfect; see TODO.txt)

  * Fonts loaded from 'data/fonts/' directory.  Font selector added!


2002.September.11
  * Updated Spanish translations.
    Gabriel Gazzan <ggabriel@internet.com.uy>
  
  * Updated Norwegian translations.
    Karl Ove Hufthammer <karl@huftis.org>

  * Fixed horrible sounding audio in Win32.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>
    Thanks to: Gabriel Gazzan <ggabriel@internet.com.uy>

  * Removed "Loading" image.

  * Fixed bug where "New" tool would be disabled if 'Open' was cancelled.

  * Ctrl-N does the same as pushing the 'New' button.

  * Added keyboard shortcuts to README.txt.

  * Reorganized and (kinda) prioritized TODO.txt.

  * Created 16x16, 32x32 and 48x48 icons for KDE.  Install them into
    wherever "kde-config --install icon" says is good, if 'kde-config' exists.

  * Started working on text tool.  (#define ENABLE_TEXT_TOOL to try it out.
    Warning: It's unusable!)


2002.September.8
  * Fixed bug in Win32 'opendir'
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * "docbook-to-man" is now optional.  (Without it, man page won't be built.)
    Thanks to Mike Simons for bash tips.

  * Updated Norwegian translations.
    Karl Ove Hufthammer <karl@huftis.org>

  * Moved list of stamp ideas from TODO.txt into stamp package's own to-do list.

  * Print tool enabled!  (Linux/Unix only; requires NetPBM tools)
  
  * Print tool can be disabled with "--noprint" on command-line, or
    "noprint=yes" in config. file (can be re-enabled with "--print" on
    command line).

  * Printing can be restricted to only one print every N seconds, with
    "--printdelay=SECONDS" on command-line, or "printdelay=SECONDS" in
    config. file.  ("--printdelay=0" will disable the restriction).
    Thanks to Koyote on #ucd for the idea.

  * Print command can be set (default is "lpr") with "printcommand=COMMAND"
    in config. file.

  * 'fopen' opens PNG for write in binary mode ("wb"; for Win32)

  * Thumbnails are now saved (making Open dialog much faster!)
    (Existing saved images without thumbnails are given thumbnails the first
    time 'Open' is clicked, too!)

  * Files in 'Open' dialog are sorted by filename (aka time/date created).
    This gets around new files ending up in 'holes' in the directory structure
    where files had been deleted.

  * Added an alpha-blended shadow behind pop-up prompts.
    (Can be disabled by #define'ing "NO_PROMPT_SHADOWS" in src/tuxpaint.c)

  * Increased number of files Tux Paint can deal with from 128 to 256.

  * Approx. doubled number of undo buffers.

  * Added progress bar to Save operation.


2002.September.6
  * Fixed translation problems in Makefile (installed italian into dutch,
    didn't uninstall some of the new ones)
    (Thanks to Ben Armstrong)

  * Updated Dutch translation (after testing on some children).
    Herman Bruyninckx <Herman.Bruyninckx@mech.kuleuven.ac.be>

  * Updated Norwegian translation (for some new strings).
    Karl Ove Hufthammer <karl@huftis.org>

  * Fixed misspelling of "occurred" in errors and warnings.
    (Thanks to Andries Brouwer for noticing)

  * Reset tool tip after Open dialog goes away.

  * do_save() returns whether there was success, so now if there wasn't,
    Tux Paint doesn't think the picture was saved, and won't quit if
    you save-on-quit and it failed.

  * A prompt shows up confirming save-on-quit.

  * Fixed problem with CTRL commands not being noticed.

  * Attempted installation skeleton for Japanese translation.
    (Nothing translated yet)

  * Changed default font to a Sans Serif font.
    From the Free UCS Outline Fonts:
    http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/freefont/

  * Removed all rubber-stamps.  They're now available as a separate download.
    (tuxpaint-stamps...)

  * 'loadarbitrary()' won't abort if it can't find any stamps.

  * Brushes tested to make sure they aren't larger than 40x40.


2002.August.23
  * Support for SDL's upcoming "WMCLASS" support.

  * Italian translation (it_IT@euro)
    Marco Milanesi <kpanic@pavia.linux.it>

  * Dutch translation (nl_BE@euro)
    Herman Bruyninckx <Herman.Bruyninckx@mech.kuleuven.ac.be>

  * Added missing Norwegian trans. install (Makefile) and docs. (README.txt)

  * Norwegian available with "--lang norsk" as well.

  * More and updated German translations (especially stamp translations).
    Ingo Blechschmidt <iblech@web.de>

  * Fixed nickel stamp (was 'colorable', so came out a solid circle).

  * Renamed US Coin stamps so that they're ordered by value.

  * Added Italian, Turkish and Dutch versions of the GPL.

  * Made cursor in 'Open' dialog look nicer.

  * Made a few of the flower stamps tintable.

  * Support for legacy saved files (BMP format).
    (Only issue is when you 'Save over', it actually makes a new file,
    since it will be ".png", not ".bmp")

  * Added details on "*PREFIX" variables in Makefile to "INSTALL.txt"
    (Spanish version of that file currently has this section in English.)

  * Added animated progress bar ('candy cane' or 'barbershop pole', since
    determining percentage of progress is quite difficult!).  Displayed
    when first starting up, as well as when creating thumbnails for the
    'Open' screen...


2002.August.19
  * Translated into Norwegian Nynorsk ("NN")
    Karl Ove Hufthammer <karl@huftis.org>

  * Finnish translation updated.
    Tarmo Toikkanen <tarmo.toikkanen@iki.fi>

  * Updated German translation of some planet stamps.
    Ingo Blechschmidt <iblech@web.de>


2002.August.19
  * Now saves in PNG format, instead of BMP.  (Huge disk space savings!)
    (Uses libPNG to save.  Note: Previously-saved BMPs can't be loaded.
    Sorry!  They must be converted to PNG.)

  * If 'current' image didn't exist, it won't ask if you wish to replace it
    when you go to save.
  
  * Added US coins, flowers and flags to rubber stamps.
    (c) Justin Zeigler 2002 Administered by The Project Impresarios of GOVIA.
    http://govia.osef.org/

  * Tool buttons disabled when 'Open' dialog is displayed.
    Fabian Franz <FabianFranz@gmx.de>

  * Stamps can be colored using the color picker.
    (Certain stamps can have this enabled.  For example, right now, the
    mathematical and musical stamps do.)  The stamp really becomes a kind
    of limited brush.  Create a "STAMP.dat" file for the stamp, and stick
    the word "colorable" in it.)
    (Thanks to Fabian Franz for the suggestion.)

  * Stamps can be tinted using the color picker.
    (Certain stamps can have this enabled.)  The stamp's brightness and
    saturation are kept, but the hue of the currently-picked color is used.
    Create a "STAMP.dat" file for the stamp, and stick the word
    "tintable" in it.)

  * LOCALE_PREFIX, the location where translation files (".mo") should be
    installed, is now based on PREFIX in Makefile.  Source has been
    updated with a 'bindtextdomain()' (which was used under Win32),
    which lets 'gettext()' find the translations, regardless of where
    they are.  (e.g., you can install as a non-root user now)

  * Updated Spanish translations of stamp descriptions.
    Gabriel Gazzan <ggabriel@internet.com.uy>

  * Selector sound effect doesn't get played when a stamp is selected
    which has its own sound effect.


2002.August.12
  * Removed rainbow magic tool's ending sound effect altogether.

  * Rubber stamp outlines now based on shape of the stamp.
    (Simple rectangle outlines available by #define'ing
    "LOW_QUALITY_STAMP_OUTLINE" at the top of src/tuxpaint.c)
    (Thanks to Ben Armstrong for the idea.)

  * Rubber stamps can have their own sound effects (STAMP.wav)
    (.e.g, "pict.wav" is the sound for the stamp "pict.png")

  * Rubber stamps can have localized sound effects (STAMP_LOCALE.wav)
    (e.g., "pict_fr.wav" and "pict_es.wav")

  * Rubber stamps directory moved out of "data/images/" and into just "data/"

  * Brush directory moved out of "data/images" and into just "data/"

  * Moved "Rainbow" and "Sparkles" magic tool buttons to the top of the
    list, since they actually DRAW things.  (So if a child goes to the
    "Magic" tool while the picture is still blank, they can at least draw
    without having to pick a specific magic tool.)

  * Fixed bug where tall and narrow stamps' thumbnails would be aligned wrong
    in their buttons on the selector.

  * Surface locking and unlocking moved to outside loops/etc.,
    rather than being WITHIN putpixel() and getpixel() functions!
    (i.e., locking occurs far less frequently, so some things, like XOR lines,
    should be sped up a little)

  * Animated filled shapes.  (On slower machines, it takes quite a while,
    so you can't tell if it's doing anything!)

  * Added Turkish translation.  (Buggy - charset needs fixing.)
    Doruk Fisek <dfisek@fisek.com.tr>

  * Resampled and trimmed some sound files (to make them smaller).

    
2002.August.9
  * Translated button labels to German.
    Fabian Franz <FabianFranz@gmx.de>

  * Translated button labels to Spanish.
    Gabriel Gazzan <ggabriel@internet.com.uy>

  * Translated button labels to French.
    Jacques Chion <Jacques.Chion@wanadoo.fr>

  * Button label font size larger, and scaled horizontally (may squish
    aspect ratio!) to fit within the buttons. (Makes things more readable.)

  * Check LANG env. variable if LC_ALL contains "LC_MESSAGES"
    Fabian Franz <FabianFranz@gmx.de>

  * Disabled warnings about description-less stamp images.
    Fabian Franz <FabianFranz@gmx.de>

  * Translated documentation directories created (docs/es, docs/fr, etc.)

  * Documentation (AUTHORS.txt, INSTALL.txt) translated to Spanish.
    Gabriel Gazzan <ggabriel@internet.com.uy>

  * Spanish, French and German versions of GPL (COPYING.txt) included.

  * Stamp images divded into "photo" and "cartoon" subdirectories,
    reorganized some.

  * More space images added (from NASA and NSSDC public domain photo
    gallery).  Planets renamed #_name.png, so that they sort in the
    correct order.

  * List of stamp ideas added to TODO.txt

  * Previous tool re-selected if you go to Quit and then decide not to.

  * Fixed bug where Redo and Undo wouldn't make Save available if you've
    just saved...

  * Fixed bug opening tuxpaint.cfg under Windows.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Fixed minor font opening/closing bugs
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Disabled sound effect wait when finishing a rainbow magic tool draw.
    (Should interrupt now, instead?)
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Translated more stamp descriptions into German, French and Spanish
    (Using Google.com's language tool.)

  * Added mathematic stamps (numbers, operators)

  * Added musical stamps (clefs, notes, rests, keys)


2002.August.4
  * Added "Thick" and "Thin" magical effects.

  * Reorganized some magical effects in the selector menu.

  * Text removed from button icons, and can now be translated using gettext!

  * Filled shapes enabled.  (Using lame radius-based fill, rather than
    scanline fill.  Couldn't get scanline fill to work yet, though.)

  * Renamed 'slash' brushes so they sort more nicely in the brush selector.

  * Gave magical effects their own sound effects.

  * Used a better 'harp' intro sound effect.


2002.August.2
  * Fixed command-line argument parsing bug.
    Ben Armstrong <synrg@sanctuary.nslug.ns.ca>

  * Fixed broken Spanish translation .po file.
    Gabriel Gazzan <ggabriel@internet.com.uy>

  * Made "wait_for_sfx()" less CPU-intensive and hopefully better on Win32(?)
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Made sure "LC_MESSAGES" dirs created by "install" in Makefile
    Ben Armstrong <synrg@sanctuary.nslug.ns.ca>

  * Added "uninstall" target to Makefile

  * Changed font to "efont.ttf", a completely free, GPL'd font.
    (See: http://openlab.ring.gr.jp/efont/serif/)

  * Added info to INSTALL.txt on making a TuxPaint shortcut under Windows,
    and using it to alter command-line options.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Added info to README.txt on ways to change language settings under
    Windows.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Win32 updates for LOCALE-related stuff.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Reduced font size (some text was overlapping or going off the screen).
    (Needs more testing)

  * Updated AUTHORS.txt some.


2002.July.31
  * Fixed memory deallocation bug in "Open" dialog function.

  * Translated to Finnish
    Tarmo Toikkanen <tarmo.toikkanen@iki.fi>

  * Update Spanish translation
    Gabriel Gazzan <ggabriel@internet.com.uy>

  * Switched from using #define'd strings for translations to using "gettext"
    and ".po" files (see src/messages/)
    Fabian Franz <FabianFranz@gmx.de>
    (Thanks to Andreas Best <a_best@web.de> for help getting locales working)

  * Added "--locale" option to override current locale at runtime
    (e.g. "--locale de_DE@euro")

  * Added "--lang" option to override current locale at runtime,
    using human-readable language names.
    (e.g. "--locale german" or "--locale deutsch")

  * Stamp descriptions now support multiple languages.
    (Each description MUST be on one line - multiple lines no longer supported!)

    Lines beginning with "xx=" (where "xx" is a locale abbreviation,
    e.g. "de" for German or "es" for Spanish) provide text for their
    respective locales.

  * Added details about stamp multilingual support to "README.txt".

  * Added more requirements to the "INSTALL.txt" documentation.

  * Supports a "~/.tuxpaintrc" file which contains default options
    (e.g. "fullscreen=yes")

  * Command-line options to disable some options
    (e.g., "--windowed" to override a "fullscreen=yes" in .tuxpaintrc)


2002.July.24
  * Fixed a bug where Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-R would do Undo and Redo even if you
    shouldn't be able to.

  * Undo and Redo disable shape tool if it's active.
    (Really, Undo should only become available AFTER the shape has been
    rotated and drawn...)


2002.July.23
  * Added more (and updated some) French translations.
    Jacques Chion <Jacques.Chion@wanadoo.fr>

  * Added first German translations
    Fabian Franz <FabianFranz@gmx.de>

    to suit the Filesystem Heirarchy Standard
    ( http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/fhs/ )
    Ben Armstrong <synrg@sanctuary.nslug.ns.ca>

  * More memory freeing cleanups.
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>


2002.July.07

    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>


2002.July.03
  * Added French language support  (#define LANG_FR)
    Most translation by:  Charles Vidal <vidalc@club-internet.fr>
    Some thanks to Babelfish.

  * Added Spanish language suppirt  (#define LANG_ES)
    Translation thanks to Babelfish.

  * Changed UI font to "chicago.ttf", since it supports international chars.

  * Now strips (converts to spaces) newlines in rubber stamp .txt files
    (mainly to avoid the "end of line" glyph in the new Chicago font).

  * Explicitly free up memory at exit
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Added "nosound" Makefile target (to build without sound or SDL_mixer)

  * Auto-saves current image (to "$HOME/.tuxpaint/current.bmp") when you
    quit.  Auto-loads it when you start back up (if it's available).
    (Creates "$HOME/.tuxpaint/" directory if it doesn't exist.)

    folder.)

  * Data file installation moved to /usr/local/lib/tuxpaint/ by default.
    (Mike Simons)

  * Documentation now installed into /usr/local/share/doc/tuxpaint/.

  * Incorporated stuff for Windows builds (win_dirent.c/h, some #defines).
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Cast surface->pixels more in get/putpixel() calls
    John Popplewell <john@johnnypops.demon.co.uk>

  * Created "INSTALL.txt" documentation on compiling and installing

  * Created "PNG.txt" documentation on creating PNG images

  * Extensive updates and fleshing-out of README.txt


2002.June.17a

  * Title screen remains until keypress or mouse click.

  * Created "install" target in Makefile

  * Created "AUTHORS.txt"

  * Replaced most calls to SDL_Flip() with calls to SDL_UpdateRect().

  * Thumbnails rendering made high-quality.  (Can be disabled by
    #define LOW_QUALITY_THUMBNAILS)

  * Stamp and brush files are sorted alphabetically by filename now.

  * Color selector buttons look like other interface buttons.
    (Can be made simple again by #define LOW_QUALITY_COLOR_SELECTOR)

  * "Tip text" and cartoon tux added for tools, colors and, if available,
    stamps.  (Store respective ".txt" files in data/images/stamps/)


2002.June.16
  * Initial release.
    Supports brushes, stamps, lines, eraser, sound effects.

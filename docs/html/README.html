<h1>About</h1>
<blockquote>

  <h2>What Is 'Tux&nbsp;Paint?'</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tux Paint is a free drawing program designed for young children
    (kids ages 3 and up). It has a simple, easy-to-use interface, fun
    sound effects, and an encouraging cartoon mascot who helps guide
    children as they use the program.  It provides a blank canvas and
    a variety of drawing tools to help your child be creative.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>License:</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tux&nbsp;Paint is an Open&nbsp;Source project, Free&nbsp;Software
    released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  It is free, and
    the 'source&nbsp;code' behind the program is available.  (This allows
    others to add features, fix bugs, and use parts of the program in their
    own GPL'd software.)</p>

  <h2>Objectives:</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>Easy and Fun</b></dt>
    <dd>
      Tux&nbsp;Paint is meant to be a simple drawing program for young children.
      It is not meant as a general-purpose drawing tool.  It <i>is</i> meant to
      be fun and easy to use.  Sound effects and a cartoon character help let
      the user know what's going on, and keeps them entertained.
      There are also extra-large cartoon-style mouse pointer shapes.
    </dd>

    <dt><b>Extensibility</b></dt>
    <dd>
      Tux&nbsp;Paint is extensible.  Brushes and "rubber stamp" shapes can be
      dropped in and pulled out.  For example, a teacher can drop in a
      collection of animal shapes and ask their students to draw an
      ecosystem.  Each shape can have a sound which is played, and
      textual facts which are displayed, when the child selects the shape.
    </dd>

    <dt><b>Portability</b></dt>
    <dd>
      Tux&nbsp;Paint is portable among various computer platforms:
      Windows, Macintosh, Linux, etc.  The interface looks the same among
      them all.  Tux&nbsp;Paint runs suitably well on older systems (like a
      Pentium&nbsp;133), and can be built to run better on slow systems.
    </dd>

    <dt><b>Simplicity</b></dt>
    <dd>
      There is no direct access to the computer's underlying intricacies.
      The current image is kept when the program quits, and reappears when
      it is restarted.  Saving images requires no need to create filenames
      or use the keyboard.  Opening an image is done by selecting it from
      a collection of thumbnails.  Access to other files on the computer is
      restricted.
    </dd>

<h1>Using Tux&nbsp;Paint</h1>
<blockquote>

  <h2>Loading Tux&nbsp;Paint</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <h3>Linux/Unix Users</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Tux Paint should have placed a laucher icon in your KDE and/or GNOME
      menus, under 'Graphics.'</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can run the following command at a shell prompt
      (e.g.,&nbsp;"$"):</p>

      <blockquote>
        <code>$ tuxpaint</code>
      </blockquote>

      <p>If any errors occur, they will be displayed on the terminal
      (to "stderr").</p>
    </blockquote>

    <hr size=1 noshade>


    <h3>Windows Users</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4 bgcolor="#AAAAFF"
      align=right summary=""><tr><td align=center>
        <img src="images/icon-win32.png" width=32 height=32 alt="[Icon]"><br>
	Tux&nbsp;Paint
      </td></tr></table>
      
      <p>If you installed Tux&nbsp;Paint on your computer using the
      'Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Installer,' it will have asked you whether you
      wanted a 'Start' menu short-cut, and/or a desktop shortcut.  If you
      agreed, you can simply run Tux&nbsp;Paint from the 'Tux&nbsp;Paint'
      section of your 'Start' menu (e.g., under "All&nbsp;Programs" on
      Windows&nbsp;XP), or by double-clicking the "Tux&nbsp;Paint" icon
      on your desktop.</p>
     
      <p>If you installed Tux&nbsp;Paint using the 'ZIP-file' download,
      or if you used the 'Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Installer,' but chose not to
      have shortcuts installed, you'll need to double-click the
      "<code>tuxpaint.exe</code>" icon in the 'Tux&nbsp;Paint' folder on
      your computer.</p>

      <p>By default, the 'Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Installer' will put
      Tux&nbsp;Paint's folder in "<code>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\</code>",
      though you may have changed this when the installer ran.</p>

      <p>If you used the 'ZIP-file' download, Tux&nbsp;Paint's folder will
      be wherever you put it when you unzipped the ZIP file.</p>

    <h3>Mac OS X Users</h3>
    <blockquote>
      Simply double-click the "Tux&nbsp;Paint" icon.<p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

  <hr size=1 noshade>


  <h2>Title Screen</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When Tux&nbsp;Paint first loads, a title/credits screen will appear.</p>

    <p align=center><img src="images/tuxpaint-title.jpg" width=324 height=254
    alt="[Title Screenshot]"></p>

    <p>Once loading is complete, press a key or click on the mouse to continue.
    (Or, after about 30&nbsp;seconds, the title screen will go away
    automatically.)</p>

  <hr size=1 noshade>


  <h2>Main Screen</h2>
  <blockquote>
    The main screen is divided into the following sections:

    <dl>
    <dt>Left Side: Toolbar</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The toolbar contains the drawing and editing controls.</p>

      <p align=center><img src="images/tools.jpg" width=324 height=254
      alt="[Tools: Paint, Stamp, Lines, Shapes, Text, Magic, Undo, Redo,
      Eraser, New, Open, Save, Print, Quit]"></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Middle: Drawing Canvas</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The largest part of the screen, in the center, is the drawing
      canvas.  This is, obviously, where you draw!</p>

      <p align=center><img src="images/canvas.jpg" width=324 height=254
      alt="[(Canvas)]"></p>
    </dd>


    <dt>Right Side: Selector</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Depending on the current tool, the selector shows different
      things.  e.g., when the Paint&nbsp;Brush tool is selected, it shows
      the various brushes available.  When the Rubber&nbsp;Stamp tool
      is selected, it shows the different shapes you can use.</p>

      <p align=center><img src="images/selector.jpg" width=324 height=254
      alt="[Selectors - Brushes, Letters, Shapes, Stamps]"></p>
    </dd>


    <dt>Lower: Colors</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>A palette of available colors are shown near the bottom of the
      screen.</p>

      <p align=center><img src="images/colors.jpg" width=324 height=254
      alt="[Colors - Black, White, Red, Pink, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan,
      Blue, Purple, Brown, Grey]"></p>

      <p>(NOTE: You can define your own colors for Tux&nbsp;Paint.
      See the "<a href="OPTIONS.html"><i>Options</i></a>"
      documentation.)</p>
    </dd>


    <dt>Bottom: Help Area</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>At the very bottom of the screen, Tux, the Linux Penguin,
      provides tips and other information while you draw.</p>

      <p align=center><img src="images/tips.jpg" width=324 height=254
      alt="(For example: 'Pick a shape. Click to pick the center, drag, then

      <dt><b>Paint (Brush)</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <img src="images/tool_paint.png" width=48 height=48 alt="" align=right>

	<p>The Paint&nbsp;Brush tool lets you draw freehand, using various
        brushes (chosen in the Selector on the right) and colors
        (chosen in the Color palette towards the bottom).</p>

        <p>If you hold the mouse button down, and move the mouse, it will
        draw as you move.</p>

        <p>As you draw, a sound is played.  The bigger the brush, the
        lower the pitch.</p>

        <br clear=all>

      <dt><b>Stamp (Rubber Stamp)</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <img src="images/tool_stamp.png" width=48 height=48 alt="" align=right>

        <p>The Stamp tool is like a rubber stamp, or stickers.  It lets you
        paste pre-drawn or photographic images (like a picture of a horse,
	or a tree, or the moon) in your picture.</p>

        <p>As you move the mouse around, an outline follows the
        mouse, showing where the stamp will be placed.</p>

        <p>Different stamps can have different sound effects.
	Some stamps can be colored or tinted.</p>
	
	<p>Stamps can be shrunk and expanded, and many stamps can be
	flipped vertically, or displayed as a mirror-image, using
	controls at the bottom right of the screen.</p>
	
	<p>(NOTE: If the "<code>nostampcontrols</code>" option is set,
	Tux&nbsp;Paint won't display the Mirror, Flip, Shrink and Grow
	controls for stamps.
	See the "<a href="OPTIONS.html"><i>Options</i></a>"
	documentation.)</p>

      <dd>
        <img src="images/tool_lines.png" width=48 height=48 alt="" align=right>

        <p>This tool lets you draw straight lines using the various
        brushes and colors you normally use with the Paint Brush.</p>

        <p>Click the mouse and hold it to choose the starting point of the
        line.  As you move the mouse around, a thin 'rubber-band' line
        will show where the line will be drawn.</p>

        <p>Let go of the mouse to complete the line.  A "sproing!" sound will
        play.</p>

      <dd>
        <img src="images/tool_shapes.png" width=48 height=48 alt=""
        align=right>

        <p>This tool lets you draw some simple filled, and un-filled shapes.</p>

	<p>Select a shape from the selector on the right (circle, square,
	oval, etc.).</p>

	<p>In the canvas, click the mouse and hold it to stretch the shape
	out from where you clicked.  Some shapes can change proportion
	(e.g., rectangle and oval), others cannot (e.g., square and circle).</p>

	<p>Let go of the mouse when you're done stretching.</p>

        <dl>
	  <dt>Normal Mode</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Now you can move the mouse around the canvas to rotate the
	    shape.</p>

	    <p>Click the mouse button again and the shape will be drawn in the
	    current color.</p>
	  </dd>

          <dt>Simple Shapes Mode</dt>
	  <dd>
            If simple shapes are enabled (e.g., with the
            "<code>--simpleshapes</code>" option),
            the shape will be drawn on the canvas when you let go of the
            mouse button.  (There's no rotation step.)

      <dt><b>Text</b></dt>

        <img src="images/tool_text.png" width=48 height=48 alt="" align=right>

        <p>Choose a font (from the 'Letters' available on the right) and a color
	(from the color palette near the bottom).  Click on the screen and a
	cursor will appear.  Type text and it will show up on the screen.</p>
	
	<p>Press <b>[Enter]</b> or <b>[Return]</b> and the text will be drawn
        onto the picture and the cursor will move down one line.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, press <b>[Tab]</b> and the text will be drawn onto
        the picture, but the cursor will move to the right of the text,
        rather than down a line, and to the left.  (This can be useful to
        create a line of text with mixed colors, fonts, styles and sizes:
        <code>Like</code> <font color="#880000"><i><b>this</b></i></font>.)</p>
	
	<p>Clicking elsewhere in the picture while the text entry is still
        active causes the current line of text to move to that location
        (where you can continue editing it).</p>

        <dl>
        <dt><b>International Character Input</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Tux Paint allows inputting characters in different languages.
          Most Latin characters (<i>A</i>-<i>Z</i>,
          <i>&ntilde;</i>, <i>egrave;</i>, etc.) can by entered directly.
          Some languages require that Tux&nbsp;Paint be switched into an
          alternate input mode before entering, and some characters must be
          composed using numerous keypresses.</p>

          <p>When Tux Paint's locale is set to one of the supported
          languages that require an alternate input mode, press
          the <b>right&nbsp;[Alt]</b> or <b>right&nbsp;[Option]</b> key to
          toggle between the normal (Latin character) and locale-specific
          modes.</p>

          <p>Currently supported locales, and their input methods, are listed
          below.  <b>Note:</b> Many fonts do not include all characters for
          all languages.

      <dt><b>Magic (Special Effects)</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <img src="images/tool_magic.png" width=48 height=48 alt="" align=right>

        <p>The 'Magic' tool is actually a set of special tools.  Select one of
	the "magic" effects from the selector on the right, and then
	click and drag around the picture to apply the effect.</p>

        <br clear=all>

        <dl>
	<dt><b>Fill</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This floods the picture with a color.  It lets you quickly
	  fill parts of the picture, as if it were a coloring book.
	</dd>

        <dt><b>Grass</b></dt>
        <dd>
          This paints grass on the image. The higher up the canvas,
          the smaller the grass is drawn, giving an illusion of perspective.
          The grass can be tinted various greenish hues by selecting
          different colors in the color palette.
        </dd>

        <dt><b>Bricks</b> (Large and Small)</dt>
        <dd>
          These two tools intelligently paint large and small brick
          patterns on the canvas.  The bricks can be tinted various redish
          hues by selecting different colors in the color palette.
        </dd>

	<dt><b>Rainbow</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This is similar to the paint brush, but as you move the mouse
	  around, it cycles through a spectrum of bright colors.
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Sparkles</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This draws glowing sparkles on the canvas, in the currently-selected
          color.
	</dd>
	  
	<dt><b>Blur</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This makes the picture fuzzy wherever you drag the mouse.
	</dd>
	  
	<dt><b>Smudge</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This pushes the colors around under the mouse, like finger painting
	  with wet paint.
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Lighten</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This fades the colors wherever you drag the mouse.
	  (Do it to the same spot many times, and it will eventually become
	  white.)
	</dd>
	
	<dt><b>Darken</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This dakrens the colors wherever you drag the mouse.
	  (Do it to the same spot many times, and it will eventually become
	  black.)
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Chalk</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This makes parts of the picture (where you move the mouse)
	  look like a chalk drawing.
	</dd>
	
	<dt><b>Blocks</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This makes the picture blocky looking ("pixelated") wherever
	  you drag the mouse.
	</dd>
	
	<dt><b>Negative</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This inverts the colors wherever you drag the mouse.
	  (e.g., white becomes black, and vice versa.)
	</dd>
	
	<dt><b>Tint</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This changes the parts of the picture to the selected color.
	</dd>
	
	<dt><b>Drip</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This makes the paint "drip" wherever you move the mouse.
	</dd>
	
	<dt><b>Cartoon</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  This makes the picture look like a cartoon &mdash; with thick
	  outlines and bright, solid colors &mdash; wherever you move the mouse.
	</dd>

	<dt><b>Mirror</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  When you click the mouse in your picture with the "Mirror"
	  magic effect selected, the entire image will be reversed,
	  turning it into a mirror image.
	</dd>
	  
	<dt><b>Flip</b></dt>
	<dd>
	  Similar to "Mirror."  Click and the entire image will be turned
	  upside-down.

        <img src="images/tool_eraser.png" width=48 height=48 alt=""
        align=right>

        <p>This tool is similar to the Paint Brush.  Wherever you click
        (or click and drag), the picture will be erased either to white,
	or to the background picture, if you began the current drawing
	with a 'Starter' image.</p>

	<p>A number of eraser sizes are available.</p>

        <p>As you move the mouse around, a square outline follows
        the pointer, showing what part of the picture will be erased to
        white.</p>

        <p>As you erase, a "squeaky clean" eraser/wiping sound is played.</p>

        <b>'Starter' Images</b>

	<blockquote>
	  <p>Along with pictures you've created, Tux&nbsp;Paint can provided
	  'Starter' images.  Opening them is like creating a new picture,
	  except that the picture isn't blank.  'Starters' can be like a page
	  from a coloring book (a black-and-white outline of a picture, which
	  you can then color in), or like a 3D photograph, where you draw
	  the bits in between.</p>

	  <p>'Starter' images have a green background in the 'Open' screen.
	  (Normal images have a blue background.)  When you load a 'Starter,'
	  draw on it, and then click 'Save,' it creates a new picture
	  (it doesn't overwrite the original 'Starter,' so you can use it
	  again later).</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>If choose to open a picture, and your current drawing hasn't been
	saved, you will be prompted as to whether you want to save it or not.
	(See "<a href="#save">Save</a>," below.)</p>
	
	<p>Note: You can also press <b>[Control]-[O]</b> on the keyboard to get
        the 'Open' dialog.</p>

	It will simply save the picture, and play a "camera shutter" sound
	effect.</p>

	<p>If you HAVE saved the picture before, or this is a picture you

	  <p><i>(Linux and Unix only)</i></p>

	  <p><i>Tux&nbsp;Paint</i> prints by generating a PostScript

	  program.  By default, the program is:</p>

          <blockquote><code>
	    lpr
	  </code></blockquote>

	  <p>This command can be changed by setting the "printcommand" value
	  in Tux&nbsp;Paint's configuration file.</p>

	  <p>If the <b>[Alt]</b> key on the keyboard is being pushed
	  while clicking the 'Print' button, as long as you're not in
	  fullscreen mode, an alternative program is run.  By default,
	  the program is KDE's graphical print dialog:</p>

          <blockquote><code>
	    kprinter
	  </code></blockquote>

	  <p>This command can be changed by setting the "altprintcommand" value
	  in Tux&nbsp;Paint's configuration file.</p>

	  <p>By default, Tux&nbsp;Paint simply prints to the default

	  pushed.</p>

	  <p>However, if you hold the <b>[Alt]</b> key on the keyboard
	  while pushing the button, as long as you're not in fullscreen mode,
	  a Windows print dialog will appear, where you can change the
	  settings.</p>

	  <p>You can have the printer configuration changes stored
	  by using the "printcfg" option, either by using
	  "<code>--printcfg</code>" on the command-line, or
	  "<code>printcfg=yes</code>" in Tux&nbsp;Paint's own configuration
	  file ("<code>tuxpaint.cfg</code>").</p>

	  <p>If the "printcfg" option is used, printer settings will
	  be loaded from the file "<code>print.cfg</code>" in your
	  personal folder (see below).
	  Any changes will be saved there as well.</p>

	  while clicking the 'Print' button.</p>

	  <p>However, this behavior can be changed.  You can have the

<h1>Loading Other Pictures into Tux&nbsp;Paint</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Since Tux&nbsp;Paint's 'Open' dialog only displays pictures you created
  with Tux&nbsp;Paint, what if you want to load some other picture or
  photograph into Tux&nbsp;Paint to edit?</p>

  <p>To do so, you simply need to convert the picture into
  a PNG (Portable Network Graphic) image file, and place it in Tux&nbsp;Paint's
  "saved" directory:</p>
  
  <dl>
  <dt>Windows</dt>
  <dd>Inside the user's "<code>Application&nbsp;Data</code>" folder,
    e.g.: <code>"C:\Documents and Settings\<i>(user&nbsp;name)</i>\Application
    Data\TuxPaint\saved\</code>"</dd>
  
  <dt>Mac OS X</dt>
  <dd>Inside the user's "<code>Library</code>" folder:
    <code>"/Users/<i>(user&nbsp;name)</i>/Library/Application Support/Tux&nbsp;Paint/saved/</code>"</dd>
  
  <dt>Linux/Unix</dt>
  <dd>Inside a hidden "<code>.tuxpaint</code>" directory, in the user's
    home directory: "<code>$(HOME)/.tuxpaint/saved/</code>"</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Using '<code>tuxpaint-import</code>'</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Linux and Unix users can use the "<code><b>tuxpaint-import</b></code>"
    shell script which gets installed when you install Tux&nbsp;Paint.
    It uses some NetPBM tools to convert the image ("<code>anytopnm</code>"),
    resize it so that it will fit in Tux&nbsp;Paint's canvas
    ("<code>pnmscale</code>"), and convert it to a PNG
    ("<code>pnmtopng</code>").</p>

    <p>It also uses the "<code>date</code>" command to get the current time and
    date, which is the file-naming convention Tux&nbsp;Paint uses for saved
    files.  (Remember, you are never asked for a 'filename' when you go to
    Save or Open pictures!)</p>

    <p>To use '<code>tuxpaint-import</code>', simply run the command from a
    command-line prompt and provide it the name(s) of the file(s) you wish
    to convert.</p>

    <p>They will be converted and placed in your Tux&nbsp;Paint 'saved'
    directory. (Note: If you're doing this for a different user - e.g.,
    your child, you'll need to make sure to run the command under their
    account.)</p>

    <p>Example:</p>

    <blockquote><code>
      $ <b>tuxpaint-import grandma.jpg</b><br>
      grandma.jpg -&gt; /home/username/.tuxpaint/saved/20020921123456.png<br>
      jpegtopnm: WRITING A PPM FILE
    </code></blockquote>

    <p>The first line ("<code>tuxpaint-import&nbsp;grandma.jpg</code>") is the
    command to run. The following two lines are output from the program while
    it's working.</p>
    
    <p>Now you can load Tux&nbsp;Paint, and a version of that original picture
    will be available under the 'Open' dialog.  Just double-click its icon!</p>
  </blockquote>


  <h2>Doing it Manually</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Windows, Mac OS X and BeOS users must currently do the conversion
    manually.</p>

    <p>Load a graphics program that is capable of both loading your picture
    and saving a PNG format file.  (See the documentation file
    "<a href="../PNG.txt">PNG.txt</a>" for a list of suggested software,
    and other references.)</p>

    <p>Reduce the size of the image to no wider than 448&nbsp;pixels across and
    no taller than 376&nbsp;pixels tall. (i.e., the maximum size
    is 448&nbsp;x&nbsp;376 pixels)</p>

    <p>Save the picture in PNG format.  It is <b>highly</b> recommended that you
    name the filename using the current date and time, since that's
    the convention Tux&nbsp;Paint uses:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <code><b>YYYYMMDDhhmmss</b>.png</code>
    </blockquote>

    <ul>
    <li>YYYY = Year
    <li>MM = Month (01-12)
    <li>DD = Day (01-31)
    <li>HH = Hour, in 24-hour format (00-23)
    <li>mm = Minute (00-59)
    <li>ss = Second (00-59)
    </ul>

    <p>e.g.:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>20020921130500</code> - for September 21, 2002, 1:05:00pm
    </blockquote>

    <p>Place this PNG file in your Tux&nbsp;Paint '<code>saved</code>'
    directory.  (See above.)</p>
  </blockquote>

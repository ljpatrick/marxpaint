Release checklist for Tux Paint
Last updated 2020-07-27 -bjk

Do these things _prior_ to cutting a release -- that is, prior to
tagging in the source code repository, running "make release" to roll
a .tar.gz source tarball, and making the tarball available for download.

 * Update version # and release dates

   Places to make sure version # and release date gets updated,

   * Makefile
  
   * Build description files:
     * tuxpaint.spec (Linux RPM package)
     * macos/Info.plist (macOS build)
     * win32/resources.rc (Windows mingw/msys build)
  
   * Documentation
     (For HTML variants, be sure to run "make" in "docs/", to
     produce plaintext alternatives!)
  
     * docs/CHANGES.txt
     * docs/en/html/README.html
     * docs/en/html/FAQ.html
     * docs/en/html/OPTIONS.html
     * docs/en/html/EXTENDING.html
     * docs/en/html/ADVANCED-STAMPS-HOWTO.html
  
   * Manual page (manpage)
     * src/manpage/tuxpaint.1

 * Tidy the HTML documentation

   Using 
   (Be sure to run "make" in "docs/", to produce plaintext alternatives!)

     tidy -i --markup yes --vertical-space yes --indent yes --indent-attributes yes INFILE.html > OUTFILE.html

   Make certain it looks okay, and stil renders properly in a browser.
   If not, correct the issues!  Then replace the original with the new
   version 'tidy' created.

 * Don't forget to commit the changes!  (git add ... / git commit / git push)

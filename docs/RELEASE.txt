Release checklist for Tux Paint
Last updated 2020-12-27 -bjk

Preparing
---------

Do these things _prior_ to cutting a release -- that is, prior to
tagging in the source code repository, running "make release" to roll
a .tar.gz source tarball, and making the tarball available for download.

 * Update version # and release dates

   Places to make sure version # and release date gets updated,

   * Makefile

   * Build description files:
     * tuxpaint.spec (Linux RPM package)
     * macos/Info.plist (macOS build)
     * win32/resources.rc (Windows mingw/msys build)

   * Documentation
     (For HTML variants, be sure to run "make" in "docs/", to
     produce plaintext alternatives!)

     * docs/CHANGES.txt
     * docs/en/html/README.html
     * docs/en/html/FAQ.html
     * docs/en/html/OPTIONS.html
     * docs/en/html/EXTENDING.html
     * docs/en/html/ADVANCED-STAMPS-HOWTO.html

   * Manual page (manpage)
     * src/manpage/tuxpaint.1

 * Tidy the HTML documentation

   (Be sure to run "make" in "docs/", to produce plaintext alternatives!)

     tidy -i --markup yes --vertical-space yes --indent yes --indent-attributes yes INFILE.html > OUTFILE.html

   Make certain it looks okay, and stil renders properly in a browser.
   If not, correct the issues!  Then replace the original with the new
   version 'tidy' created.

 * Don't forget to commit the changes!  (git add ... / git commit / git push)


Time to release:
----------------

 * Tag & roll a release tarball (example here was from 0.9.25):

   $ git pull
   $ make clean
   $ git tag tuxpaint-0_9_25-2020-12-27
   $ git push origin tuxpaint-0_9_25-2020-12-27 # or --tags
   $ make release

 * Upload each project's ".tar.gz" file from their "build/" subdirs
   to ftp.tuxpaint.org.

 * Place them in the appropriate subdirectories (source/, config/,
   and stamps/) under "unix/x/tuxpaint/".

 * Copy "docs/CHANGES.txt" from each project onto the FTP site
   (Tux Paint's goes in the toplevel, the others go in config/ and
   stamps/).

 * Create a new PAD file (e.g. `pads/tuxpaint-0.9.25.xml`) on the
   FTP site.

 * Replace the "pads/tuxpaint-LATEST.xml" symlink on the FTP site with
   a new one that points to the new PAD file.

 * At SourceForge, go to "Files" and use "Add Folder" under each project
   to create new release file subdirectories.  (e.g., "0.9.25" under
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxpaint/files/tuxpaint/)

 * Upload the files!  Either from local copies, via a web browser,
   or by SCP, Rsync, or SFTP (see
   https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Release%20Files%20for%20Download/#scp)

   e.g.:

     $ sftp wkendrick@frs.sourceforge.net
     sftp> cd /home/frs/project/tuxpaint/

     sftp> cd tuxpaint/0.9.25/
     sftp> lcd source
     sftp> put tuxpaint-0.9.25.tar.gz

     sftp> cd ../..
     sftp> lcd ..

   [repeat for tuxpaint-config and tuxpaint-stamps]

 * Copy latest release's documentation to the tuxpaint.org website.

TuxPaint Xcode Project
notes by Martin Fuhrer <mfuhrer@alumni.ucalgary.ca>

This TuxPaint project file is located in a folder titled "macosx", which should in turn be placed in the root folder of the TuxPaint source code distribution. The project will then be able to access all the source code files.

This XCode project assumes that you have certain libraries and files installed in particular locations under Mac OS X.  This file indicates what you must install, and where these items go.  Some of the libraries are installed via the Fink package manager, which can be downloaded from <fink.sourceforge.net>


-- SDL --

You must have the following frameworks installed in /Library/Frameworks:

SDL.framework
SDL_image.framework
SDL_mixer.framework
SDL_ttf.framework

These frameworks should ideally be the non-development versions (without the header files), as they will be copied into the Tux Paint bundle.  You can obtain the frameworks from the SDL website <www.libsdl.org>

So where does the project reference the SDL header files, if they are not in the frameworks?  Via the Fink installation of SDL.  So be sure to install all SDL-related packages in Fink.


-- PNG and Internationalization Libraries --

Install PNG (libpng.a) and the GNU internationalization library (libintl.a) via Fink.  These libraries will be statically linked into the TuxPaint binary.


-- Translation Files --

These are generated by the Makefile in the TuxPaint source distribution as follows:

make translations
make install-gettext

This will generate translation files in /usr/local/share/locale.  Move the locale folder into the root folder of the TuxPaint source distribution, and the TuxPaint XCode project will be able to bundle the files into the TuxPaint application.

This font is required to run Marx Paint in Japanese.
(e.g., with the "--lang japanese" option)

This font contains only the characters needed to display the strings
found in Marx Paint.

This is a custumized subset of Sazanami-Gothic.ttf for MarxPaint.
Difference between original are, 

  a) Bitmap data which prevent correct rendering (due to SDL_ttf
     bug) are removed.
  b) All Kanji data not used in MarxPaint are removed.
